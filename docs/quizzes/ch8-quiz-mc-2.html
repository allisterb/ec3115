                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>Firms hire labor until the real wage (W/P) equals the marginal product of labor (MPL). The principle of diminishing marginal product states that as more labor is added (holding capital fixed), the additional output from each new unit of labor decreases. Therefore, firms are only willing to hire more workers if the real wage falls. This inverse relationship between the real wage and the quantity of labor demanded results in a downward-sloping labor demand curve.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>Superneutrality is a stronger condition than neutrality. Neutrality means a change in the *level* of the money supply does not affect real variables. Superneutrality means a change in the *rate of growth* of the money supply (and thus the long-run inflation rate) does not affect real variables like the real interest rate or the level of output. The basic classical model is superneutral, but this property can fail if, for example, a real-balance effect is introduced.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>In a repeated game between the government and the private sector, the government may choose to forego the short-run gain from surprise inflation. By doing so, it can build a reputation as an inflation-fighter (a "hard-nosed" type). This reputation leads the public to maintain low inflation expectations, making it possible to achieve the Pareto-superior zero-inflation outcome in subsequent periods. The cycle begins when the incentive to inflate eventually outweighs the benefit of maintaining the reputation.</p>

                    <p>By repeatedly substituting for the lagged expectation term (\(\Pi_{t-1}\), \(\Pi_{t-2}\), etc.), the adaptive expectations formula can be expressed as an infinite distributed lag of past inflation rates: \(\Pi_t = \lambda \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} (1-\lambda)^j \Delta p_{t-j}\). This shows that the expected inflation rate is a geometrically weighted average of all past inflation rates, with more recent inflation rates receiving more weight.</p>

                    <p>Plosser argues that a key strength of the RBC approach is that it does not treat growth and fluctuations as separate phenomena requiring different theories. The same factors that drive economic growth (e.g., permanent changes in technology) also cause the transitory dynamics and fluctuations we call business cycles. The model provides a single, consistent framework for understanding both.</p>

                    <p>The adaptive expectations hypothesis is a backward-looking mechanism. If inflation is consistently rising, for example, an agent using adaptive expectations will consistently under-predict inflation. This is a systematic error. The New Classical critique, which led to the adoption of rational expectations, is that rational agents would notice such systematic errors and adjust their forecasting method to eliminate them.</p>

                    <p>The position of the vertical AS curve is determined by the equilibrium level of employment \(l^*\). A change in the elasticity (slope) of the labor supply curve does not change the initial equilibrium point, assuming the labor demand curve is unchanged. Therefore, \(l^*\) and \(y^*\) do not change, and the AS curve does not shift. However, a more elastic labor supply curve means that any shift in the labor demand curve (e.g., from a technology shock) would lead to a larger change in employment and a smaller change in the real wage.</p>

                    <p>The concept of trading at "false" (i.e., non-Walrasian, non-market-clearing) prices arises in a world without a Walrasian auctioneer, where prices are set for discrete periods. If prices are set incorrectly, markets will not clear. Trades will occur at these non-clearing prices, and agents will be quantity-constrained (e.g., firms cannot sell all they want, workers cannot sell all the labor they want). This quantity adjustment is the hallmark of Keynesian analysis.</p>

                    <p>A core tenet of RBC theory is that the observed fluctuations are not market failures. They are the efficient, optimal responses of rational agents to changes in the economic environment (e.g., technology). Forcing the economy onto a smoother path would prevent agents from making these optimal adjustments (e.g., investing more during a temporary productivity boom), thereby making them worse off. The equilibrium is Pareto-efficient, so no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.</p>

                    <p>A fundamental principle of intertemporal choice is consumption smoothing. When faced with a temporary positive shock to income (from a productivity increase), rational, risk-averse agents will choose not to consume all the extra income at once. Instead, they save/invest a large portion of it to support higher consumption in future periods as well. This makes investment highly responsive to income shocks (volatile) while consumption follows a smoother path.</p>

                    <p>The cash-in-advance constraint \(P_t C_t \le M_{t-1}\) means that the purchasing power of cash is eroded by inflation. Higher inflation (a higher \(P_t\) for a given \(P_{t-1}\)) reduces the amount of real goods \(C_t\) that can be bought with a given nominal cash balance \(M_{t-1}\). This makes consumption more expensive relative to leisure. Households respond by consuming less and taking more leisure, which means they supply less labor, leading to a fall in equilibrium output.</p>

                    <p>A major challenge for early RBC models was matching the observed volatility of hours worked. Microeconomic studies suggest a low elasticity of labor supply, meaning people don't change their work hours much in response to wage changes. However, RBC models needed a high elasticity (high intertemporal substitution) to generate realistic fluctuations in employment. This discrepancy between micro data and macro model requirements is a key puzzle that led to further research (e.g., indivisible labor models).</p>

                    <p>In RBC models that do not include pre-existing distortions like taxes, the business cycle fluctuations are the result of optimal choices by rational agents in response to real shocks.

                    <p>In the generalized model of trading at non-market-clearing prices, different regions of disequilibrium can exist. "Classical Unemployment" occurs when there is an excess supply of labor (unemployment) but an excess demand for goods. In this situation, the real wage is too high. Firms cannot hire all the workers they want at a lower wage, and the only way to increase employment is for the real wage to fall. This contrasts with "Keynesian Unemployment," where there is excess supply in both the goods and labor markets.</p>

One then solves for \(E_t p_{t+1}\) in terms of \(E_t p_{t+2}\), and so on. By substituting these expressions back into the original equation, one can express the current variable as a function of the entire future path of expected exogenous variables.
