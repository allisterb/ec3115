        <div class="question-block" id="q0" data-answer="false">
            <p class="question-text">1. A time series' trend component represents the short-run ups and downs, or booms and recessions, in aggregate economic activity.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. The trend component of a time series, often called potential output, represents the long-run growth path of the economy. It is driven by slow-moving factors like capital accumulation, population growth, and technological progress. The business cycle component, by contrast, captures the shorter-term, recurrent but non-periodic fluctuations (booms and recessions) of actual output around this long-run trend. The entire purpose of business cycle analysis is to separate these two components to study the nature of the fluctuations.

        <div class="question-block" id="q1" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">2. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is a common method for separating a time series into its trend and cyclical components.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. The HP filter is a widely used statistical tool in macroeconomics to decompose a time series \(Y_t\) into a trend component (\(\tau_t\)) and a cyclical component (\(c_t\)). It does so by solving a minimization problem that penalizes both the deviation of the series from its trend and the variability of the trend itself. The trade-off is controlled by a smoothing parameter, \(\lambda\). (Source: EC3115 Subject Guide, Ch 6).</div>

        <div class="question-block" id="q2" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">3. In business cycle analysis, volatility refers to the standard deviation of the cyclical component of a macroeconomic variable.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Volatility is a measure of the amplitude of the business cycle fluctuations. It is calculated as the standard deviation of the cyclical component of a variable (which is usually in log form, making it an approximation of percentage deviations). It allows us to compare the size of fluctuations across different variables, such as consumption and investment. (Source: EC3115 Subject Guide, Ch 6).</div>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="question-block" id="q3" data-answer="false">
            <p class="question-text">4. A variable is considered 'procyclical' if its cyclical component is negatively correlated with the cyclical component of GDP.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. A variable is procyclical if its cyclical component is positively correlated with the cyclical component of GDP. This means it tends to be above its trend when GDP is above its trend (expansion) and below its trend when GDP is below its trend (recession). A negative correlation defines a countercyclical variable. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

        <div class="question-block" id="q4" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">5. 'Persistence' in a time series refers to the degree to which the current value of the series is correlated with its past values.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Persistence, measured by the first-order autocorrelation of the cyclical component, describes the tendency for deviations from trend to be prolonged. A high positive persistence (e.g., +0.9) means that if a variable is above its trend today, it is very likely to still be above its trend in the next period. GDP and its components show strong persistence. (Source: EC3115 Subject Guide, Ch 6).</div>

        <div class="question-block" id="q5" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">6. A key stylised fact of business cycles is that consumption is less volatile than GDP.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Empirical evidence for most developed countries shows that aggregate consumption is smoother (has a lower standard deviation) than aggregate output (GDP). This is a crucial fact that macroeconomic models must explain, and it provides support for theories of consumption smoothing like the Permanent Income Hypothesis. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="question-block" id="q6" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">7. Investment is typically found to be countercyclical.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. Investment is one of the most strongly procyclical components of GDP. It rises significantly during economic expansions as firms build new capacity and falls sharply during recessions. Furthermore, it is far more volatile than GDP.

        <div class="question-block" id="q7" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">8. Total hours worked is a procyclical variable.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Total hours worked, a measure of labor input, moves closely with the business cycle. Firms employ more labor (both by hiring more people and increasing hours per worker) during booms and reduce labor input during recessions. Its volatility is typically similar to that of GDP. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

        <!-- Question 9 -->
        <div class="question-block" id="q8" data-answer="false">
            <p class="question-text">9. The price level is consistently and strongly procyclical across all historical periods and countries.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. The cyclicality of the price level (or inflation) is not a settled fact and has changed over time. For the US, the price level was generally procyclical before World War II but has been generally countercyclical in the post-war period. This change may reflect a shift from demand-driven cycles to supply-driven cycles. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3; EC3115 Subject Guide, Ch 6).</div>

        <!-- Question 10 -->
        <div class="question-block" id="q9" data-answer="true">
            <p class="question-text">10. Money supply (e.g., M1 or M2) is generally a procyclical and leading variable.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Historically, the money supply has tended to be procyclical, expanding in booms and contracting in recessions. It is also often found to be a leading variable, meaning its cyclical movements tend to precede those of GDP. However, the stability and usefulness of this relationship for policymaking has been questioned since the 1980s. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3; Friedman & Kuttner).</div>

        <div class="question-block" id="q10" data-answer="false">
            <p class="question-text">11. The correlation between the cyclical components of two variables is sufficient to establish a causal relationship between them.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. This is a classic statistics fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation. While stylised facts document correlations (e.g., money leads output), they do not, by themselves, tell us whether one variable causes the other, if there is reverse causation, or if both are driven by a third, omitted factor. Establishing causality requires economic theory and more advanced econometric techniques. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

            <p class="question-text">12. Real wages are generally found to be procyclical.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Most studies for the US and other developed countries find that real wages are procyclical, meaning they tend to rise during expansions and fall during recessions. However, the correlation with GDP is often not very strong, and some early Keynesian theories predicted countercyclical real wages, making this an important area of research.

            <p class="question-text">13. Government spending is more volatile than GDP.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. Generally, government consumption and investment spending is found to be less volatile than GDP. Its cyclicality can vary; in the US, it is often found to be procyclical, though this can be heavily influenced by large military expenditures. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

            <p class="question-text">14. The term 'acyclical' describes a variable whose cyclical component has no clear correlation (i.e., close to zero) with the business cycle.</p>
            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Acyclical variables are those that do not move in a predictable pro- or counter-cyclical way with the business cycle. Their correlation with the cyclical component of GDP is near zero. Some studies find real interest rates to be acyclical. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. This is a standard practice for comparability. After taking natural logs of a series, the cyclical component is calculated as the actual log value minus the log trend value. This difference, when small, is a close approximation of the percentage deviation from the trend. (Source: EC3115 Subject Guide, Ch 6).</div>

            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. A 'leading' variable is one whose cyclical turning points (peaks and troughs) occur before the turning points of GDP. It helps predict the future path of the economy. Volatility refers to the amplitude of fluctuations, not the timing. A variable can be leading and less volatile than GDP. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is true. Inventory investment is a strongly procyclical component of GDP. Firms build up inventories during expansions in anticipation of future sales and draw them down during contractions. Although small on average, inventory investment is highly volatile and accounts for a disproportionate share of the fall in GDP during recessions. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

            <div class="explanation-content" style="display: none;">This is false. The volatility of total hours worked is typically greater than the volatility of employment (the number of people working). This is because firms adjust labor input on two margins: the extensive margin (hiring/firing people) and the intensive margin (changing hours per worker). Total hours captures both effects, making it more volatile than the number of employees alone. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

While consumption moves with the cycle, this fact alone does not tell us whether shocks to consumption are the primary cause of the cycle or whether consumption is simply responding to other shocks (like technology or investment shocks) that are the true drivers of the cycle. Most modern business cycle models view consumption as responding to, rather than causing, the cycle. (Source: Williamson, Macroeconomics, Ch 3).</div>

The Goodwin model (1967) is a famous early model of endogenous cycles that describes a predator-prey-like relationship between the employment rate and the workers' share of national income. High employment erodes profits, which reduces investment and employment, which in turn restores profits, starting the cycle again. It is not about investment and consumption directly.
