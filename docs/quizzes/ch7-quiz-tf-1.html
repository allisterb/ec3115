                <p>The Fisher equation, defined as \(R_t = r_t + \pi_{t+1}^e\), describes the relationship where the nominal interest rate (\(R_t\)) is the sum of the real interest rate (\(r_t\)) and the expected inflation rate (\(\pi_{t+1}^e\)). This relationship holds because lenders require compensation for the expected loss of purchasing power due to inflation. Sources: EC3115 Subject Guide, Chapter 7; McCallum (1989), Chapter 6.</p>

                <p>The primary welfare cost of a steady, *anticipated* inflation (often called the 'shoe-leather cost') arises because it increases the nominal interest rate, which is the opportunity cost of holding money. This induces people to hold less money and incur costs from more frequent trips to the bank to manage their cash. Source: McCallum (1989), Chapter 6.</p>

                <p>Seigniorage is the profit made by a government by issuing currency, especially the difference between the face value of coins and their production costs.

                <p>The inflation tax is a tax on *real* money balances. It is the reduction in the real value of money holdings caused by inflation. The revenue from this tax is the rate of inflation multiplied by the real money base. Sources: Mizen (2000), Chapter 7; Cagan (1956).</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>There is a maximum amount of revenue that can be raised through the inflation tax. As the inflation rate rises, people reduce their real money holdings. Beyond a certain point, the erosion of the tax base (real money balances) outweighs the increase in the tax rate (inflation), and total revenue falls. This relationship is often depicted by the 'inflation tax Laffer curve'. Source: Dornbusch (1992).</p>

                <p>Phillip Cagan (1956) provided the most widely used definition of hyperinflation: a period beginning in the month the inflation rate first exceeds 50% per month and ending in the month before the monthly inflation rate drops below that level and stays below it for at least a year.

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>During hyperinflations, the cost of holding money (the expected rate of inflation) becomes extremely high. Consequently, people flee from money, and real money balances shrink dramatically. Source: Cagan (1956).</p>

                <p>Neutrality means a one-time change in the level of the money supply affects only nominal variables. Superneutrality means a change in the *growth rate* of the money supply does not affect real variables. In the standard classical model, a change in the money growth rate (and thus the inflation rate) affects the demand for real balances, which can have real effects (the Mundell-Tobin effect), meaning money is not superneutral.

                <p>Friedman's rule for the optimal quantity of money states that the nominal interest rate should be zero. This equates the private opportunity cost of holding money to the social cost of creating it (which is near zero), inducing people to hold money to the point of full liquidity, maximizing social welfare. This is achieved by a rate of deflation equal to the real interest rate. Source: McCallum (1989), Chapter 6.</p>

                <p>Cagan's (1956) model simplifies the demand for money by assuming that during hyperinflation, the expected rate of price change is the dominant variable affecting the cost of holding money, swamping the effects of real income or other interest rates. Source: Cagan (1956).</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>While hyperinflation is disruptive, Cagan (1956) notes that a surprising feature is that real income and output often do *not* fall dramatically compared to the astronomical increases in prices and money. The key puzzles relate to the behavior of real balances, the shortage of currency, and the motives for money creation. Source: Cagan (1956).</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>The opportunity cost of holding money (which pays no interest) is the return on alternative assets. The relevant measure is the nominal interest rate, as this is the return foregone by not holding an interest-bearing asset like a bond. Source: McCallum (1989), Chapter 5.</p>
