    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q1">
        <p class="question">1. The Fisher equation describes the relationship between which of the following?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> a) Money supply, velocity, and nominal income</label>

        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">The Fisher equation states that the nominal interest rate (R) is the sum of the real interest rate (r) and the expected rate of inflation (\(\pi^e\)). The relationship is expressed as \(R_t = r_t + \pi_{t+1}^e\). This holds because rational lenders require compensation for the expected loss of purchasing power due to inflation, in addition to the real return on their lending.

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q2">
        <p class="question">2. What is the primary reason for the distinction between the ex-ante and ex-post real interest rate?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> a) The nominal interest rate is fixed, but the real rate fluctuates.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> b) The actual rate of inflation is not known when a nominal interest rate is agreed upon.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> c) Tax laws treat nominal and real interest income differently.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> d) Central bank policy targets nominal rates but is concerned with real rates.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">The ex-ante real interest rate (\(r^A = R_t - \pi_{t+1}^e\)) is the real return expected at the time a loan is made. The ex-post real interest rate (\(r^P = R_t - \pi_{t+1}\)) is the actual real return realized after the fact. The distinction is necessary because the actual inflation rate (\(\pi_{t+1}\)) over the loan period is unknown when the nominal rate (\(R_t\)) is set. Decisions are based on the ex-ante rate, which incorporates expected inflation.

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q3">
        <p class="question">3. The concept of 'superneutrality' of money implies that a change in the rate of growth of the money supply affects:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> a) Only the rate of inflation and nominal interest rates, with no effect on real variables like output or the real interest rate.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> b) Both the rate of inflation and the level of real output.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> c) Only the real interest rate, leaving inflation and output unchanged.</label>

        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Superneutrality is a stronger condition than neutrality. While neutrality means a one-time change in the money supply level affects only nominal variables, superneutrality means a change in the *rate of growth* of the money supply affects only nominal variables (like the inflation rate and nominal interest rate) but has no effect on *real* variables, including the real interest rate and real output.

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q4">
        <p class="question">4. When is monetary policy neutral but NOT superneutral?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> a) When prices are sticky and the economy is in a liquidity trap.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> b) When a change in the money growth rate alters the real interest rate.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> c) When a one-time change in the money supply has no effect on real output.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> d) When the central bank targets the nominal interest rate instead of the money supply.</label>

        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Monetary policy is not superneutral if a change in the rate of monetary growth (and thus inflation) affects real variables. The Mundell-Tobin effect is a key example. Higher anticipated inflation reduces the real return on money, causing individuals to reduce their real money balances. This fall in real wealth can lead to increased saving, which in turn lowers the real interest rate to restore goods market equilibrium. Since the real interest rate changes, money is not superneutral, even if it is neutral in a static sense.

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q5">
        <p class="question">5. The Mundell-Tobin effect describes a situation where higher anticipated inflation leads to:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> a) A higher real interest rate and lower investment.</label>

        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">The Mundell-Tobin effect posits that higher expected inflation reduces the real value of money balances. This reduction in wealth induces households to save more to restore their wealth. The increase in saving (an outward shift of the IS curve in a standard model) leads to a lower equilibrium real interest rate, which stimulates real investment.

    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q6">
        <p class="question">6. According to Friedman's rule, what is the optimal rate of inflation for maximizing social welfare?</p>
        <div class="options">

        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Friedman's rule for the optimal quantity of money states that social welfare is maximized when the nominal interest rate is zero (R=0). This eliminates the opportunity cost of holding money, inducing people to hold real balances to the point of satiation (full liquidity). According to the Fisher equation (R = r + \(\pi\)), a zero nominal interest rate requires a rate of price deflation (a negative inflation rate) equal to the real rate of interest (\(\pi = -r\)).

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q7">
        <p class="question">7. The welfare cost of a steady, anticipated inflation is often represented by the "shoe-leather cost." This cost refers to:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> a) The resources used by the government to print new money.</label>

        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Anticipated inflation raises the nominal interest rate, which is the opportunity cost of holding money. To avoid this cost, individuals hold lower real balances and must make more frequent trips to the bank (wearing out their "shoe leather") to manage their cash. This time and effort represents a real resource cost to society, as it diverts resources from productive activities. This welfare loss is quantified by the area under the money demand curve.

            <p class="explanation">In consumer surplus analysis, the height of a demand curve at any quantity represents the marginal value or utility to the consumer of that unit. Therefore, the total area under the demand curve for real money balances up to a certain quantity represents the total utility or transaction-facilitating services that individuals receive from holding that amount of money.

            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Seigniorage is the real revenue or purchasing power a government obtains by virtue of its monopoly power to create money. For fiat money, the cost of production is near zero, so the government can acquire real goods and services by printing money and spending it. This represents a transfer of real resources from the public (who hold the money) to the government.

This money creation leads to inflation, which erodes the real value of the public's existing money holdings. This loss of purchasing power is an implicit tax on holding money. The revenue from this tax is the rate of inflation (the tax rate) multiplied by the stock of real money balances (the tax base).

            <p class="explanation">The Cagan model simplifies the money demand function for the extreme conditions of hyperinflation. It posits that changes in real income and real interest rates are dwarfed by the massive changes in inflation. Therefore, the primary variable determining the demand for real money balances is the expected rate of inflation, which represents the cost of holding money. The specific form is \(\ln(M/P) = -\alpha E - \gamma\).

To avoid this "inflation tax," the public reduces their desired real money balances to a fraction of their initial value. This attempt to spend money as quickly as possible is known as the "flight from money" and corresponds to a massive increase in the velocity of circulation.

This ensures the labor market always clears at the full-employment level of employment (n*), which in turn determines the full-employment level of output (y*) via the production function. This results in a vertical aggregate supply curve.

        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q47" value="a"> a) The Classical model assumes a fixed capital stock, while the Keynesian model does not.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q47" value="b"> b) The Keynesian model assumes firms are not profit-maximizers.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q47" value="c"> c) The Classical model assumes a vertical aggregate supply curve, while the Keynesian model assumes an upward-sloping one.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q47" value="d"> d) The Keynesian model assumes a vertical aggregate supply curve, while the Classical model assumes an upward-sloping one.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">The Classical model assumes fully flexible wages and prices, which means the labor market always clears at the full-employment level, resulting in a vertical aggregate supply curve at potential output \(y^*\). The Keynesian model assumes that nominal wages are "sticky" or predetermined. With a fixed nominal wage, a higher price level reduces the real wage (W/P), inducing firms to hire more labor and produce more output, resulting in an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve.

    <!-- Question 48 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q48">
        <p class="question">48. In the context of the inflation tax, what happens to the government's real revenue if it sets an inflation rate that is on the elastic portion of the money demand curve?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q48" value="a"> a) Real revenue is maximized.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q48" value="b"> b) Real revenue could be increased by lowering the inflation rate.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q48" value="c"> c) Real revenue could be increased by raising the inflation rate.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q48" value="d"> d) Real revenue becomes negative.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">This is the standard Laffer curve argument. If the tax rate (inflation) is in the elastic region of the demand curve for the tax base (real balances), it means the government has gone "over the top" of the Laffer curve. A further increase in the inflation rate would cause real balances to fall by a more-than-proportionate amount, leading to a decrease in total real revenue. To increase revenue, the government would need to lower the inflation rate.

    <!-- Question 49 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q49">
        <p class="question">49. According to Friedman's "restatement" of the quantity theory, the theory is in the first instance a theory of:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q49" value="a"> a) The demand for money.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q49" value="b"> b) The determination of the price level.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q49" value="c"> c) The determination of nominal income.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q49" value="d"> d) The transmission of monetary policy.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Friedman's crucial first point in his 1956 restatement was to reframe the quantity theory not as a mechanical theory of the price level, but as a theory of the demand for money. He argued it is a stable function of a limited number of variables. The stability of this demand function is the key proposition that allows changes in the money supply to have predictable effects on nominal income.

    <!-- Question 50 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q50">
        <p class="question">50. In the Cagan model of hyperinflation, if the reaction index \(\alpha\beta < 1\), the price level is said to be:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q50" value="a"> a) Statically stable but dynamically unstable.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q50" value="b"> b) In a stable, self-correcting equilibrium.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q50" value="c"> c) Unstable and self-generating, leading to an explosive path for prices.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q50" value="d"> d) Converging to a new, higher equilibrium price level.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">In Cagan's model, the term \(\alpha\beta\) is the 'reaction index', where \(\alpha\) is the semi-elasticity of money demand and \(\beta\) is the coefficient of expectation adjustment. If \(\alpha\beta < 1\), the model implies a stable dynamic equilibrium. This means that after a shock, the price level will not explode but will converge back to a stable path determined by the underlying money supply process.
