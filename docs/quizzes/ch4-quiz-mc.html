            <div class="explanation" id="exp1">
                <p class="explanation-text">Financial intermediaries facilitate the flow of funds from lenders to borrowers. Their key functions include administrative efficiencies, risk pooling (diversification), and maturity transformation. Setting monetary policy is the role of the central bank, not private financial intermediaries.</p>

            <div class="explanation" id="exp2">
                <p class="explanation-text">Maturity transformation is vital because it reconciles the conflicting desires of savers (who prefer to keep their assets liquid and accessible, i.e., 'go short') and borrowers (who prefer to have financing for longer-term projects, i.e., 'go long'). Banks bridge this gap by taking short-term deposits and making long-term loans.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">For a commercial bank, deposits represent money it owes to its customers, so they are liabilities. Loans represent money that is owed to the bank, so they are assets from which the bank earns interest income.</p>

            <div class="explanation" id="exp4">
                <p class="explanation-text">A balance sheet is an expression of the fundamental accounting equation. A bank's assets (what it owns) must equal the sum of its liabilities (what it owes to others) and its net worth or equity (the owners' stake). Net worth is the residual that ensures the sheet balances.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">The monetary base (MB or H) consists of the total liabilities of the central bank.

                <p class="explanation-text">The primary tool for changing the monetary base is open market operations. To increase the base, the central bank purchases government bonds from the banking system. It pays for these bonds by crediting the reserve accounts of the commercial banks, thereby increasing total reserves (R) and, consequently, the monetary base.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">When the central bank buys bonds from a commercial bank, the commercial bank exchanges one asset (bonds) for another (reserves).

            <div class="explanation" id="exp9">
                <p class="explanation-text">The process of fractional reserve banking means that an initial injection of reserves into the banking system is lent out multiple times. Each round of lending creates new deposits, which are then partially held as reserves and partially lent out again. This re-lending cycle results in a total expansion of the money supply that is a multiple of the initial increase in the monetary base.</p>

            <p class="question-text">10. The formula for the money supply (M) is given by \( M = m 	imes MB \), where \(m\) is the money multiplier and \(MB\) is the monetary base. The multiplier \(m\) is formally expressed as:</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">The simple deposit multiplier (1/r) does not account for the public's decision to hold currency. The more sophisticated money multiplier incorporates both the banks' reserve ratio (r = R/D) and the public's currency-deposit ratio (c = C/D). The derivation shows that \( m = rac{C/D + 1}{C/D + R/D} = rac{c+1}{c+r} \).</p>

        <div class="question-block" id="q11">
            <p class="question-text">11. How does an increase in the public's desire to hold currency (a higher currency-deposit ratio, c) affect the money multiplier?</p>

            <div class="explanation" id="exp11">
                <p class="explanation-text">When the public holds more currency, less money is deposited in the banking system. This leakage of funds from the banking system weakens the re-lending cycle. With less money available for banks to lend out at each stage, the overall expansion of the money supply is smaller. Therefore, an increase in 'c' decreases the money multiplier 'm'.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">A higher reserve ratio means that for every dollar of deposits, commercial banks must hold a larger fraction in reserves and can lend out a smaller fraction.

                <p class="explanation-text">A significant drawback of a commodity standard is the cost of producing the monetary commodity itself. As Sir Roy Harrod remarked, it involves using valuable labor and capital to dig gold out of the ground in one place only to rebury it in vaults in another. Fiat money, being nearly costless to produce, avoids this inefficiency.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">Because banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, they cannot satisfy all depositors if everyone tries to withdraw their funds at once (a bank run). The system's viability depends on the confidence of depositors that their funds are safe and can be withdrawn when needed. Once confidence exists, few feel the need to withdraw, allowing the bank's liabilities (deposits) to serve as money.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">The choice of instrument depends on the source of instability. If money demand is stable but the money supply multiplier is volatile (e.g., due to unpredictable bank behavior), fixing the monetary base (H) will lead to large fluctuations in M. In this case, fixing the interest rate (R) can lead to more accurate control over M, as it insulates the outcome from money supply shocks.</p>

                <p class="explanation-text">Because required reserves cannot be lent out and typically earn no interest, they impose an opportunity cost on the bank. To maintain profitability (the zero-profit condition), the bank must compensate for this cost. It does so by increasing the spread between its loan rate and deposit rate, effectively charging a higher loan rate than it would without the reserve requirement. This increase in the cost of lending is analogous to a tax.</p>
