                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>In the classical model, the economy's output is determined on the supply side. The aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full-employment level of output, \(y^*\). This level of output is determined by the equilibrium in the labor market and the economy's production function, \(y = f(k, l)\), where \(k\) (capital) and \(l\) (labor) are the factor inputs. Changes in aggregate demand only affect the price level, not the level of real output.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the concept of monetary neutrality. In the classical model, a change in the money supply leads to a proportional change in all nominal variables (like the price level and nominal wages) but has no effect on real variables (like output, employment, and the real wage). The real wage (W/P) remains unchanged because both W and P increase by the same proportion.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>The aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full-employment (or natural) level of output, \(y^*\). This is because output is determined by factor markets (labor and capital) and technology, which are independent of the price level in the classical framework. Any change in the price level is met with a proportional change in the nominal wage, keeping the real wage and thus employment and output constant.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>Profit-maximizing firms in a competitive market will hire labor until the cost of an additional unit of labor (the real wage, W/P) is equal to the benefit from that additional unit (the marginal product of labor, MPL). This condition, \(W/P = MPL\), defines the labor demand curve.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>In the Lucas misperceptions model, producers have imperfect information. They can observe the price of their own good but not the aggregate price level. An unexpected increase in the money supply causes all prices to rise. A producer sees their own price rise and 'misperceives' part of this general price increase as a relative price increase for their specific good. Believing the relative price of their good has risen, they increase production. This leads to a short-run upward-sloping aggregate supply curve, \(Y_t = y^* + d(P_t - E_{t-1}[P_t])\), and allows unexpected monetary policy to have real effects.</p>

                    <p>RBC theory extends the classical model and argues that business cycles are not market failures but are the natural and efficient responses of the economy to real shocks, primarily technology shocks. Fluctuations in output, employment, etc., are seen as optimal adjustments by rational agents to changes in production possibilities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>A key mechanism in many RBC models is that households can substitute leisure across time. A temporary positive technology shock raises the current real wage, making current leisure relatively more expensive than future leisure. Rational individuals will respond by working more today (substituting away from expensive current leisure) and planning for more leisure in the future when the real wage is expected to be lower.</p>

                    <p>The policy-ineffectiveness proposition, emerging from models combining rational expectations with a natural rate hypothesis, argues that if economic agents have rational expectations, they will anticipate any systematic policy actions by the central bank. They will adjust their price expectations accordingly, neutralizing any potential real effects of the policy. Only unsystematic, surprise monetary policy can affect real output.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>In CIA models, households must hold cash from the previous period to purchase consumption goods in the current period. The constraint is \(P_t C_t \le M_{t-1}\). An increase in the inflation rate (\(\pi_t\)) between \(t-1\) and \(t\) reduces the real value of the cash balances brought into the period, effectively making consumption goods more expensive. This "inflation tax" leads households to substitute away from consumption and towards leisure, thus reducing labor supply and output.</p>

                    <p>The time inconsistency problem arises when a policy that is optimal for the government to announce ex-ante is no longer optimal to execute ex-post. For example, a government announces a zero-inflation policy. If the public believes this and forms low inflation expectations, the government then has an incentive to create surprise inflation to boost output temporarily. Rational agents anticipate this incentive, disbelieve the announcement, and the economy ends up with an inefficiently high inflation rate.</p>

                    <p>Limited participation models create a channel for monetary policy to have real effects by assuming that monetary injections (e.g., via open market operations) flow first to financial intermediaries (banks). Other agents, like households, only adjust their portfolios with a lag. This creates a short-run "liquidity effect" where the increased supply of loanable funds from banks lowers the interest rate, stimulating investment and output before prices fully adjust.</p>

This makes the AS curve steep. If aggregate shocks are not very variable, they will attribute the price change to a relative price shift and change output significantly, making the AS curve flatter.

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>In the Friedman/Lucas classical framework, \(y^*\) is the "natural rate" of output, which is the efficient level that would be "ground out by the Walrasian system." It has normative properties of full employment and efficiency. In contrast, the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) that emerges from models with imperfect competition (like New Keynesian models) is simply the level of unemployment/output where inflation is stable. Due to market imperfections (e.g., union bargaining power), it is not necessarily the socially optimal or efficient level of output.</p>

                    <p>Lucas's point is that despite the wide variety of institutional and political arrangements across different market economies, the qualitative statistical properties of business cycles (e.g., consumption is smooth, investment is volatile, employment is procyclical) are remarkably similar.

                    <p>A technological improvement raises the marginal product of labor (MPL) at every level of employment. Since the labor demand curve is the MPL curve, it shifts to the right.

Since output cannot change, the only way to restore equilibrium in the goods market is for the real interest rate (r) to rise, which reduces (crowds out) private investment (i) to make room for the increased government spending. The equation is \(y^* = C(y^* - \tau) + i(r) + g\). As g increases, r must rise to decrease i.</p>

                    <p>The Lucas critique is a fundamental argument against using traditional econometric models for policy advice. Lucas argued that the parameters of these models (e.g., the slope of the Phillips curve) are not structural but are reduced-form parameters that depend on agents' expectations, which in turn depend on the policy regime. If the policy regime changes, agents' expectations will change, causing the model's parameters to shift and rendering policy simulations invalid.</p>

                    <p>In limited participation models, it is assumed that when the central bank conducts an open market operation, the initial liquidity injection goes to financial intermediaries (banks). Households are "limited" in that they do not participate in these asset markets continuously and only adjust their portfolios (cash holdings vs. bonds) with a lag. This segmentation allows the monetary shock to have a short-run liquidity effect on interest rates, which then affects real activity.</p>

Knowing this, the public expects inflation, and the government's best response is to validate those expectations, leading to an equilibrium with positive inflation.</p>

Rational agents will factor the expected increase in the money supply into their expectation of the aggregate price level, \(E_{t-1}[P_t]\). Therefore, when the actual price level \(P_t\) rises, there is no price surprise (\(P_t - E_{t-1}[P_t] = 0\)). Without a price surprise, there is no reason for producers to change their output level, so output remains at \(y^*\) and the policy is neutral.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>A binding minimum wage (a real wage floor above the equilibrium level) is a classic example of a price control. At this artificially high real wage, firms will demand less labor (moving up their labor demand curve) while more individuals will want to work (moving up the labor supply curve). The resulting excess supply of labor is classical unemployment. This is a case where an institutional friction prevents the wage from being flexible and clearing the market.</p>
