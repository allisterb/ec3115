    <!-- Question 51 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q51">
        <p class="question">51. In the classical model, the assumption that money is neutral implies that the aggregate supply curve is:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q51" value="a"> a) Horizontal</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q51" value="b"> b) Upward-sloping</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q51" value="c"> c) Downward-sloping</label>

        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Monetary neutrality means that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables, including real output. This is a core feature of the classical model, where fully flexible wages and prices ensure that output is always at its full-employment or "natural" level, \(y^*\). Therefore, the aggregate supply curve is a vertical line at \(y^*\), indicating that output is independent of the price level.

    <!-- Question 52 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q52">
        <p class="question">52. The total real revenue from the inflation tax can be decomposed into which two components?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q52" value="a"> a) The tax on currency and the tax on bank deposits.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q52" value="b"> b) The real value of new money issued and the reduction in the real value of outstanding monetary liabilities.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q52" value="c"> c) The revenue from anticipated inflation and the revenue from unanticipated inflation.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q52" value="d"> d) The tax paid by households and the tax paid by firms.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">As shown by Cagan, the total real revenue from inflation is the sum of two parts. The first is the purchasing power of the new money being printed (\(dM/dt \times 1/P\)). The second is the capital loss imposed on the holders of the existing money stock as inflation erodes its value (\(-d(M/P)/dt\)).

    <!-- Question 53 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q53">
        <p class="question">53. In the Cagan model, the parameter \(\beta\) in the adaptive expectations formula \(dE/dt = \beta(C-E)\) represents:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q53" value="a"> a) The elasticity of money demand.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q53" value="b"> b) The natural rate of unemployment.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q53" value="c"> c) The coefficient of expectation, indicating the speed of adjustment of expectations.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q53" value="d"> d) The government's budget deficit as a share of GDP.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">The parameter \(\beta\) is the "coefficient of expectation." It determines how quickly people revise their expectations of inflation (E) based on the error between the actual inflation rate (C) and their previous expectation. A higher \(\beta\) means expectations adjust more rapidly to recent experience.

    <!-- Question 54 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q54">
        <p class="question">54. Why might real money balances RISE towards the very end of a hyperinflation?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q54" value="a"> a) Because real income is growing rapidly.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q54" value="b"> b) Because the government stops printing money entirely.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q54" value="c"> c) Because the public begins to anticipate a currency reform and an end to the inflation.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q54" value="d"> d) Because the nominal interest rate falls to zero.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">This is a puzzle that the simple Cagan model cannot explain. The most plausible hypothesis is that as rumors of a credible currency reform spread, the public anticipates that the high inflation will soon end. The expected cost of holding money falls, leading to an increase in the demand for real balances even while the current inflation rate is still extremely high.

    <!-- Question 55 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q55">
        <p class="question">55. The concept of "monetarist superneutrality" as an empirical idea suggests that:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q55" value="a"> a) All inflations are caused by monetary growth.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q55" value="b"> b) There is no consistent relationship between inflation and real output growth in the long run.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q55" value="c"> c) The liquidity effect of a monetary expansion is very short-lived.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q55" value="d"> d) The real interest rate is always constant.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Monetarist superneutrality is the idea that an inflationary equilibrium is largely invariant to the rate of monetary growth. Once transition effects are over, variations in money growth are reflected predominantly in inflation, not in real variables like output growth. The cross-country study by McCandless and Weber, cited by Mizen, supports this by finding no consistent relationship between long-run inflation and real output growth.

    <!-- Question 56 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q56">
        <p class="question">56. In Friedman's analysis of the demand for money, what is the primary budget constraint for an ultimate wealth-holder?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q56" value="a"> a) Current disposable income.</label>

        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Friedman treated money as a capital asset, one of several ways to hold wealth. Therefore, the demand for money is a portfolio decision. The relevant budget constraint for a portfolio choice is the total wealth that must be allocated among different assets, not the flow of current income.

    <!-- Question 57 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q57">
        <p class="question">57. What is a key distinction between seigniorage and the inflation tax in a growing economy?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q57" value="a"> a) Seigniorage is always larger than the inflation tax.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q57" value="b"> b) The inflation tax only exists if inflation is positive, while seigniorage can exist even with zero inflation.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q57" value="c"> c) Seigniorage is revenue from creating money, while the inflation tax is an explicit tax on wealth.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q57" value="d"> d) They are identical concepts.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Seigniorage is the government's revenue from its monopoly on money creation. In a growing economy with zero inflation, the government can still earn seigniorage by printing money to meet the growing demand for real balances. The inflation tax, however, is specifically the revenue gained from the erosion of real balances due to positive inflation. Thus, seigniorage can be positive even if the inflation tax is zero.

    <!-- Question 58 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q58">
        <p class="question">58. According to the Dornbusch model, a key factor that can turn high inflation into an explosive hyperinflation is:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q58" value="a"> a) A sudden increase in real output growth.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q58" value="b"> b) The shortening of wage and financial contract lengths.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q58" value="c"> c) A switch from adaptive to rational expectations.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q58" value="d"> d) The government successfully balancing its budget.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">Dornbusch emphasizes the role of institutional adaptation. As inflation rises, wage contracts, financial contracts, and tax collection lags all shorten. This institutional disintegration makes the inflation rate far more sensitive and volatile. A small shock can trigger a shift to even shorter contracts, causing the inflation process to become explosive.

        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">The inflation tax revenue is the tax rate (the rate of inflation, \(\pi\)) multiplied by the tax base. The tax base is the amount of real money people continue to hold during the inflation. Therefore, the revenue is \(\pi \times (M/P)_1\), where \((M/P)_1\) is the new, lower level of real balances.

        <p class="question">60. The classical dichotomy refers to the idea that:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q60" value="a"> a) The economy can be separated into a real sector and a monetary sector, where the monetary sector does not influence the real sector.</label>

            <p class="explanation">The classical dichotomy is the theoretical separation of the economy into a real side and a nominal side. In this view, real variables like output, employment, and the real interest rate are determined purely by real factors (technology, preferences, resource endowments). The monetary sector, including the money supply, only determines nominal variables like the price level and the nominal wage rate.

    <div class="question-container" id="q61">
        <p class="question">61. In the Cagan model, if the coefficient of expectation \(\beta\) is very high (close to 10.0), it implies that:</p>

            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">With a vertical LM curve, money demand \(M/P = L(y)\) does not depend on the interest rate. An increase in the nominal money supply M shifts the LM curve to the right. To restore equilibrium at the same level of output y, the price level P must rise proportionally to bring the real money supply M/P back to its original level. This is a key tenet of the quantity theory of money.

            <p class="explanation">The real balance effect introduces real money balances (M/P) as an argument in the consumption function. A higher rate of inflation reduces M/P. This reduction in real wealth causes households to consume less and save more, shifting the IS curve. This shift leads to a change in the equilibrium real interest rate, thus breaking superneutrality.

He proposed that a change in monetary growth first affects output after about 6-9 months. The effect on prices comes later, after another 9-15 months. The total delay for inflation to respond is therefore the sum of these, averaging 15 to 24 months.

In an environment of steady inflation, where the price level (P) is constantly rising, the real wage (W/P) would be constantly falling. It is implausible that workers would accept a fixed nominal wage under such conditions. A sensible analysis requires modifying the model to allow for ongoing nominal wage increases.

            <p class="explanation">The expectation of a future currency reform means the expected rate of inflation (E) falls. According to the money demand function \(M/P = e^{-\alpha E}\), a fall in E leads to an increase in the demand for real money balances (M/P). Since the nominal money supply (M) is held constant, the only way for real balances (M/P) to increase is for the current price level (P) to fall.

    <!-- Question 100 -->
    <div class="question-container" id="q100">
        <p class="question">100. In the Dornbusch model of chronic inflation where \(\pi = gV\), if velocity (V) is an increasing function of inflation (\(V(\pi)\)), what ensures a stable low-inflation equilibrium?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q100" value="a"> a) The government deficit (g) must be zero.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q100" value="b"> b) The \(V(\pi)\) curve must be steeper than the \(\pi/g\) line at the equilibrium point.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q100" value="c"> c) The \(V(\pi)\) curve must be less steep than the \(\pi/g\) line at the equilibrium point.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q100" value="d"> d) The model always has two unstable equilibria.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
            <p class="result"></p>
            <p class="explanation">For the low-inflation equilibrium (Point E in the diagram) to be stable, a small increase in inflation must set in motion forces that return it to equilibrium. If inflation rises slightly, velocity V rises. This causes inflation to rise further (since \(\pi = gV\)). For stability, this feedback must be dampened. This occurs if the rise in V is less than the rise in \(\pi/g\). Graphically, this means the \(V(\pi)\) curve must intersect the \(\pi = gV\) line from above, i.e., it must be flatter than the line at the intersection point.
