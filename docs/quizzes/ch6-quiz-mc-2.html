        question: "In the context of the representative consumer model, what is the consumer's fundamental trade-off?",
        options: [
            "Between two different consumption goods.",
            "Between consumption and saving.",
            "Between consumption and leisure.",
            "Between domestic and imported goods."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "In a one-period, static model, there is no future, so the concept of saving (forgoing consumption today for consumption tomorrow) does not exist. The consumer's only choice is how to allocate their available time between working to earn income for consumption and not working (leisure). To consume more, one must work more, which necessarily means having less leisure time.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'The Representative Consumer'."
    },
    {
        question: "What condition is met at the optimal consumption bundle for the representative consumer?",
        options: [
            "The marginal rate of substitution of leisure for consumption equals the quantity of taxes (MRS_l,C = T).",
            "The marginal rate of substitution of leisure for consumption equals the real wage (MRS_l,C = w).",
            "The marginal product of labor equals the marginal rate of substitution (MPN = MRS_l,C).",
            "The real wage equals the dividend income (w = \pi)."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The optimum occurs at the tangency point between the budget constraint and an indifference curve. The slope of the indifference curve is the negative of the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS), representing the rate at which the consumer is *willing* to trade leisure for consumption. The slope of the budget constraint is the negative of the real wage (-w), representing the rate at which the market *allows* them to trade leisure for consumption. At the optimum, these two must be equal: MRS_l,C = w.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'Consumer Optimization'."
    },
    {
        question: "An increase in real non-wage income (e.g., higher dividend income or lower lump-sum taxes) has what effect on the consumer's budget constraint?",
        options: [
            "It becomes steeper.",
            "It becomes flatter.",
            "It shifts outward in a parallel fashion.",
            "It pivots around the endowment point."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the real wage (-w), which dictates the trade-off between consumption and leisure. Non-wage income (like dividends, \pi, or lump-sum taxes, T) is a pure income effect. It changes the total resources available to the consumer without altering the market price of leisure. Therefore, the entire budget line shifts outward, parallel to the original line, allowing more of both goods to be consumed.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'How Does the Representative Consumer Respond to a Change in Real Dividends or Taxes?'."
    },
    {
        question: "Assuming consumption and leisure are normal goods, what is the effect of an increase in the real wage on the quantity of consumption and labor supply?",
        options: [
            "Consumption increases, labor supply increases.",
            "Consumption decreases, labor supply is ambiguous.",
            "Consumption increases, labor supply is ambiguous.",
            "Consumption is ambiguous, labor supply increases."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "An increase in the real wage has two opposing effects on leisure (and thus labor supply): 1) The Substitution Effect: The opportunity cost of leisure is now higher, so the consumer substitutes away from leisure and towards work (labor supply increases). 2) The Income Effect: The consumer is wealthier and, since leisure is a normal good, they 'buy' more of it (labor supply decreases). The net effect on labor supply is ambiguous. However, for consumption, both effects are positive: the substitution effect encourages more consumption, and the income effect also encourages more consumption (as it's a normal good).",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'The Representative Consumer and Changes in the Real Wage'."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the profit-maximizing condition for the representative firm?",
        options: [
            "It hires labor until the marginal product of labor equals total factor productivity (MPN = z).",
            "It hires labor until the marginal product of labor equals the real wage (MPN = w).",
            "It hires labor until the marginal product of capital equals the real wage (MPK = w).",
            "It hires labor until total revenue equals total cost."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "A firm maximizes profit by applying the marginal principle. It will hire an additional unit of labor as long as the marginal benefit (the extra output produced, MPN) is greater than or equal to the marginal cost (the real wage, w, it must pay). The firm stops hiring when the output from the last worker is exactly equal to their wage, i.e., MPN = w. Hiring beyond this point would mean paying the worker more than they produce, resulting in a loss on that unit.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'The Profit Maximization Problem of the Representative Firm'."
    },
    {
        question: "The property of 'constant returns to scale' in a production function Y = zF(K, N) means that if all inputs are doubled, output will:",
        options: [
            "More than double.",
            "Less than double.",
            "Exactly double.",
            "Remain unchanged."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Constant returns to scale is a homogeneity property. It means that if all inputs (K and N) are multiplied by a factor 'x', output (Y) will be multiplied by the same factor 'x'. Formally, zF(xK, xN) = x * zF(K, N). In this case, x=2, so output exactly doubles. This property is a standard assumption in many macroeconomic models.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'The Representative Firm'."
    },
    {
        question: "What does an increase in Total Factor Productivity (TFP), z, do to the production function graph (with output on the vertical axis and labor on the horizontal axis)?",
        options: [
            "Shifts it down and makes it flatter.",
            "Shifts it up and makes it steeper.",
            "Causes a movement along the curve.",
            "Makes it linear."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "TFP (z) acts as a multiplier on the production function, Y = zF(K,N). An increase in 'z' means more output can be produced for any given level of labor input, causing the entire function to shift upward. Furthermore, the slope of the production function is the Marginal Product of Labor (MPN). Since MPN = z * F_N(K,N), an increase in 'z' also increases the MPN for any given N, making the curve steeper.",
        source: "Williamson,S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 4, 'The Effect of a Change in Total Factor Productivity on the Production Function'."
    },
    {
        question: "In the one-period model, what is the equilibrium effect of an increase in government purchases (G) on consumption and employment?",
        options: [
            "Consumption increases, employment increases.",
            "Consumption increases, employment decreases.",
            "Consumption decreases, employment increases.",
            "Consumption decreases, employment decreases."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "In this model, government spending is financed by lump-sum taxes (G=T). An increase in G causes an equal increase in T, which acts as a pure negative income effect on the representative consumer. Since both consumption and leisure are assumed to be normal goods, the consumer responds to this negative income shock by reducing their consumption of both. A reduction in leisure implies an increase in labor supply, and thus employment.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 5, 'Working with the Model: The Effects of a Change in Government Purchases'."
    },
    {
        question: "The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics states that, under certain conditions, a competitive equilibrium is:",
        options: [
            "Pareto optimal.",
            "Always equitable.",
            "Achieved only with government intervention.",
            "Characterized by zero unemployment."
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "This theorem is the formal expression of Adam Smith's 'invisible hand'. It states that if markets are complete and all agents are price-takers (i.e., there are no externalities or market power), the resulting competitive equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal. This means it's impossible to reallocate resources to make someone better off without making at least one person worse off. It does not, however, make any claims about the fairness or equity of the outcome.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 5, 'Optimality'."
    },
    {
        question: "Which of the following is a reason why a competitive equilibrium might NOT be Pareto optimal in the real world?",
        options: [
            "The existence of a single numeraire good.",
            "The presence of externalities like pollution.",
            "The assumption of rational consumers.",
            "The law of one price."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "A key condition for the First Welfare Theorem to hold is the absence of externalities. An externality occurs when an economic activity imposes a cost or benefit on a third party not involved in the transaction. Since the market price does not reflect this external cost (e.g., a factory polluting a river), the private incentives of the firm do not align with the social good, leading to an inefficient outcome (e.g., overproduction and too much pollution).",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 5, 'Sources of Social Inefficiencies'."
    },
    {
        question: "The 'Laffer Curve' illustrates the relationship between:",
        options: [
            "The tax rate and total tax revenue.",
            "Government spending and GDP.",
            "Inflation and unemployment.",
            "The real wage and labor supply."
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The Laffer Curve shows the theoretical relationship between tax rates and the resulting level of tax revenue. It posits that at tax rates of 0% and 100%, tax revenue is zero. As the rate increases from 0%, revenue rises, but after a certain point, the high tax rate discourages work and investment so much that the tax base shrinks, causing total revenue to fall. The curve highlights that a tax rate cut could, in some circumstances, increase tax revenue.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 5, 'A Distorting Tax on Wage Income, Tax Rate Changes, and the Laffer Curve'."
    },
    {
        question: "In the one-sided search model, the 'reservation wage' (w*) is the wage at which the worker is:",
        options: [
            "Indifferent between accepting the job and continuing to search.",
            "Guaranteed to receive a job offer.",
            "Able to maximize their unemployment benefits.",
            "Willing to enter the labor force."
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The reservation wage is the critical threshold for a job seeker. It is the wage that makes the value of being employed exactly equal to the value of remaining unemployed and continuing to search. A worker will accept any offer at or above w* and reject any offer below it. It is the point of indifference.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 6, 'The Reservation Wage'."
    },
    {
        question: "In the one-sided search model, what is the effect of an increase in unemployment insurance (UI) benefits?",
        options: [
            "It decreases the reservation wage and decreases the unemployment rate.",
            "It increases the reservation wage and decreases the unemployment rate.",
            "It decreases the reservation wage and increases the unemployment rate.",
            "It increases the reservation wage and increases the unemployment rate."
        ],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: "An increase in UI benefits makes the state of being unemployed less costly and more attractive. This increases the value of unemployment (V_u), making workers more selective about the jobs they accept. They will hold out for a better offer, which means their reservation wage (w*) increases. Because they now reject a larger fraction of job offers, the average duration of an unemployment spell lengthens, leading to a higher aggregate unemployment rate.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 6, 'An Increase in Unemployment Insurance Benefits'."
    },
    {
        question: "The 'low wage growth puzzle' observed in recent years refers to:",
        options: [
            "Rising unemployment with rising inflation.",
            "Declining unemployment without a significant increase in wage growth or inflation.",
            "A flattening of the yield curve.",
            "A decrease in labor force participation."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "This refers to the post-2008 financial crisis period in many advanced economies. Standard economic theory, particularly the Phillips Curve, suggests that as labor markets tighten and unemployment falls, there should be upward pressure on wages, which then feeds into price inflation. The puzzle was the empirical observation that unemployment rates fell to multi-decade lows, yet wage growth and inflation remained stubbornly low.",
        source: "EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "One proposed explanation for the flattening of the Phillips curve and the low wage growth puzzle is:",
        options: [
            "An increase in the bargaining power of labor unions.",
            "A decrease in the natural rate of unemployment due to eroded worker bargaining power from automation.",
            "A sudden increase in total factor productivity.",
            "A shift in central bank policy to target M2 growth."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "If workers have less power to bargain for higher wages—perhaps due to globalization, de-unionization, or the threat of their jobs being automated—then even a very low unemployment rate will not translate into significant wage pressure. This erosion of bargaining power can effectively lower the 'natural' rate of unemployment (the rate consistent with stable inflation) and cause the observed flattening of the Phillips curve relationship.",
        source: "EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "What does GDP measurement typically leave out, potentially understating true economic welfare?",
        options: [
            "Government spending on defense.",
            "The value of investment goods.",
            "The value of non-market activity, such as work in the home.",
            "The value of exports."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "GDP is a measure of market production. It therefore excludes all economic activity that does not have a market price. This includes valuable work done within the home (e.g., childcare, cooking), illegal activities, and the informal or 'underground' economy. It also fails to account for environmental degradation or changes in leisure time, making it an imperfect measure of overall societal well-being.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 2, 'What Does GDP Leave Out?'."
    },
    {
        question: "The difference between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Product (GNP) is:",
        options: [
            "Depreciation of the capital stock.",
            "Net factor payments from abroad.",
            "Indirect business taxes.",
            "The statistical discrepancy."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "GDP measures the value of production that occurs within a country's geographical borders. GNP measures the value of production by a country's citizens and firms, regardless of where it occurs. The difference is Net Factor Payments (NFP), which is income earned by domestic residents from their foreign assets minus income paid to foreign residents for their domestic assets. For example, the profits of a Toyota plant in the US are part of US GDP but Japanese GNP.",

    },
    {
        question: "A key problem with using a fixed-weight price index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is that it:",
        options: [
            "Does not account for government purchases.",
            "Is updated too frequently.",
            "Does not account for consumer substitution away from goods that have become relatively more expensive.",
            "Only includes the prices of durable goods."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The CPI measures the cost of a fixed basket of goods over time. However, when the price of a good (e.g., apples) rises relative to another (e.g., bananas), consumers naturally buy fewer apples and more bananas. Because the CPI basket is fixed, it doesn't capture this substitution and continues to assign the original high weight to the now-expensive apples, thus overstating the true increase in the cost of living. This is known as substitution bias.",

            "Net Taxes",
            "Nominal Exports",
            "Net Exports (Exports minus Imports)"
        ],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: "This is the expenditure approach to calculating GDP. Y (GDP) is the sum of all spending: C (Consumption by households), I (Investment by firms and households), G (Government purchases), and NX (Net Exports). NX represents the net spending by the rest of the world on this country's goods and services, calculated as total exports minus total imports.",

            "A household buying a new car.",

            "A car manufacturer producing a car that is not sold by the end of the year.",
            "The government purchasing a new fighter jet."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Investment (I) in the national accounts includes fixed investment (new structures and equipment) and inventory investment. Inventory investment is the change in the stock of unsold goods. A car produced but not sold is added to the firm's inventory. For accounting purposes, it is treated as if the firm 'bought' the car from itself. This ensures that production (which adds to GDP) is matched by a corresponding expenditure.",

        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "This identity shows the two uses of a nation's saving. National saving (S) is the portion of income not consumed by households or the government. This saving can either be used to fund domestic capital formation (Investment, I) or to lend to foreigners by acquiring foreign assets. The net acquisition of foreign assets is the Current Account Surplus (CA). If CA is positive, the country is a net lender to the world; if negative, it is a net borrower.",
