        {
            "question": "The concept of 'monetary neutrality' implies that a change in the stock of money affects both nominal and real variables in the long run.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Monetary neutrality means that a change in the money stock only affects nominal variables (like the absolute price level) but does not affect real variables (like output, employment, and relative prices) in the long run. Money is seen as a 'veil'.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3; Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4."
        },
        {
            "question": "The Quantity Theory of Money, in its crude form, posits that an exogenous change in the money supply causes a proportionate change in the absolute price level.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "This is the core proposition of the crude Quantity Theory. Assuming the velocity of circulation (V) and the volume of transactions (T) are constant, a change in the money supply (M) must lead to a proportional change in the price level (P), as seen in the equation MV = PT.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 47."
        },
        {
            "question": "The Classical Dichotomy refers to the idea that the real and monetary sectors of the economy are inextricably intertwined.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The Classical Dichotomy is the concept that the real and monetary sectors are separate. Relative prices are determined in the real sector by forces of supply and demand, while the absolute price level is determined in the monetary sector by the quantity of money.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 61."
        },
        {
            "question": "Walras' Law states that the sum of the values of excess demands across all markets must equal zero.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "Walras' Law is a fundamental principle in general equilibrium theory. It follows from the budget constraints of individuals and implies that if n-1 markets are in equilibrium, the nth market must also be in equilibrium.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 52."
        },
        {
            "question": "Patinkin argued that the classical model was internally consistent without the need for a real balance effect.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Patinkin's central critique was that the classical model was internally inconsistent. He demonstrated an 'invalid dichotomy' because the model treated the demand for money inconsistently. He introduced the real balance effect to resolve this inconsistency.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 58."
        },
        {
            "question": "The real balance effect describes how changes in the nominal money supply affect consumption and investment, holding the price level constant.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The real balance effect refers to the change in spending caused by a change in the real value of money balances (M/P). A change in M or P alters real wealth, which in turn influences demand for goods and services.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 4, p. 78."
        },
        {
            "question": "In the Cambridge version of the quantity theory, `k` represents the fraction of real income that people wish to hold in the form of nominal money balances.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "In the Cambridge equation, M = kPY, `k` represents the proportion of nominal income (PY) that economic agents wish to hold as money balances. It is related to the demand for money as a store of value.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 49."
        },
        {
            "question": "According to the Fisher equation (MV=PT), if V and T are constant, a 10% increase in the money supply (M) will lead to a 10% increase in the price level (P).",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "This demonstrates the direct proportionality between money and prices in the crude quantity theory. If M increases by 10%, and V and T are fixed, P must also increase by 10% to maintain the identity.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 59."
        },
        {
            "question": "The homogeneity postulate in the classical model states that the demand for goods is a function of relative prices and real income, and is homogeneous of degree one in absolute prices.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The homogeneity postulate states that the demand functions for goods are homogeneous of degree zero in money prices and the absolute price level. This means that a proportionate change in all money prices (and the absolute price level) leaves the quantity demanded of goods unchanged because relative prices and real endowments do not change.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 56."
        },
        {
            "question": "A central bank can increase the total money supply by conducting an open market sale of government bonds.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "An open market sale of bonds by the central bank involves commercial banks paying the central bank, which reduces their reserves. This reduces the monetary base and leads to a multiple contraction of the total money supply, not an increase.",
            "source": "Mizen, P.D. (1994), Chapter 2."
        },
        {
            "question": "Increasing the mandatory reserve ratio for commercial banks will typically lead to an expansion of the money supply.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "A higher reserve ratio means banks must hold a larger fraction of deposits as reserves and can lend out less. This reduces the money multiplier, leading to a contraction of the overall money supply for a given monetary base.",
            "source": "Mizen, P.D. (1994), Chapter 2."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a barter economy, Walras' Law holds, implying that a general glut (excess supply across all goods markets) is impossible.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "In a barter system with n-1 goods, Say's Law holds as an identity ($\sum p_i ED_i \equiv 0$). This means excess demand in one market must be matched by excess supply in another. A general excess supply across all markets cannot occur.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 56."
        },
        {
            "question": "Patinkin showed that by including real money balances in the demand functions for goods, the classical dichotomy becomes valid.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Patinkin's inclusion of the real balance effect invalidates the classical dichotomy. It creates a link whereby changes in the absolute price level (a monetary variable) affect the real demand for goods, thus breaking the separation between the real and monetary sectors.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 63."
        },
        {
            "question": "The velocity of circulation (V) is the reciprocal of the Cambridge k (V = 1/k).",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "The Fisher equation can be written as MV = PY and the Cambridge equation as M = kPY. Rearranging the first gives M = (1/V)PY. Comparing the two shows that k = 1/V. A higher desire to hold money (k) implies a lower velocity of circulation (V).",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 50."
        },
        {
            "question": "In the classical system, the interest rate is determined in the money market.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "In the classical system, the rate of interest is a real variable determined in the market for loanable funds by the real forces of productivity (investment demand) and thrift (savings).",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 69."
        },
        {
            "question": "According to Hume's specie-flow mechanism, a surplus in the balance of payments leads to an inflow of gold, an increase in the money supply, and consequently a rise in the domestic price level.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "This is the essence of the automatic adjustment mechanism under the gold standard. The price rise reduces the country's competitiveness, eventually correcting the balance of payments surplus.",
            "source": "Mizen, P.D. (1994), Chapter 2, p. 36."
        },
        {
            "question": "The 'direct effect' of a money supply increase in classical theory refers to its impact on the interest rate.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The 'direct effect' refers to the direct impact on aggregate demand. With more money than desired, individuals spend the excess directly on goods and services, bidding up the price level until real balances are restored to their desired level.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 65."
        },
        {
            "question": "The 'indirect effect' of a money supply increase involves the banking system and the loanable funds market.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "The indirect mechanism, associated with Thornton and Wicksell, posits that an increase in money supply leads to increased bank deposits, a greater supply of loans, a fall in the market interest rate below the natural rate, and thus increased investment and aggregate demand.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 66."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a Walrasian general equilibrium model for a barter economy, it is possible to determine the absolute price level but not relative prices.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The opposite is true. The system of n-1 excess demand equations can determine the n-2 relative prices. However, because the demand functions are homogeneous of degree zero in prices, the absolute price level is indeterminate.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 57."
        },
        {
            "question": "Say's Identity states that the excess demand in the goods markets as a whole is identically equal to zero.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "Say's Identity ($\sum p_i ED_i \equiv 0$ for goods markets) is a stronger proposition than Walras' Law. It implies that a general glut of goods is impossible, as excess supply in one goods market must be matched by excess demand in another goods market.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 61."
        },
        {
            "question": "A key assumption for monetary neutrality is that economic agents do not suffer from 'money illusion'.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "Absence of money illusion means that individuals make decisions based on real variables (relative prices, real income, real wealth), not nominal variables. A proportionate change in all nominal values (prices and money) should not change real behavior.",
            "source": "Patinkin, D. 'Neutrality of money' in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance."
        },
        {
            "question": "The monetary base consists of currency in circulation plus the total deposits held at commercial banks.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The monetary base (or high-powered money) consists of currency held by the public plus the reserves (currency and deposits) held by commercial banks at the central bank.",
            "source": "Friedman, M. 'The quantity theory of money' in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance."
        },
        {
            "question": "In the classical view, money is neutral in the short run but not in the long run.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The classical view is the opposite. Money is considered neutral in the long run, affecting only prices. However, many classical economists, including Hume, acknowledged that money could have temporary, short-run effects on real variables like output and employment.",
            "source": "Patinkin, D. 'Neutrality of money' in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance."
        },
        {
            "question": "The 'tâtonnement' or 'groping' process describes how a Walrasian auctioneer adjusts relative prices to find a general equilibrium.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "The auctioneer calls out a set of prices, observes the resulting excess demands and supplies, and then 'gropes' towards equilibrium by raising prices for goods in excess demand and lowering them for goods in excess supply.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 51."
        },
        {
            "question": "Patinkin's model with a real balance effect implies that Say's Law holds as an identity.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The real balance effect invalidates Say's Identity. For example, a fall in the price level increases real balances and can lead to an excess demand for all goods simultaneously, a situation impossible under Say's Identity.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 63."
        },
        {
            "question": "The classical theory of the interest rate is known as the liquidity preference theory.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The classical theory is the loanable funds theory, where the interest rate balances the supply of loanable funds (from saving) and the demand for loanable funds (for investment). Liquidity preference is Keynes's theory of interest rate determination.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 69."
        },
        {
            "question": "If the money supply is doubled, the neutrality of money implies that the real value of money balances (M/P) will also double.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Neutrality implies that if the nominal money supply (M) doubles, the price level (P) will also double in the long run. This means the real value of money balances (M/P) returns to its original level, leaving it unchanged.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 66."
        },
        {
            "question": "The money multiplier is the ratio of the total money supply to the monetary base.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "The money multiplier shows how a one-unit change in the monetary base (high-powered money) leads to a multiple change in the broader money supply. Its size depends on the currency-deposit ratio and the reserve-deposit ratio.",
            "source": "Friedman, M. 'The quantity theory of money' in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance."
        },
        {
            "question": "In the Walrasian system, if there are `n` markets, only `n-2` of the market-clearing equations are independent.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "If there are `n` markets (e.g., n-1 goods and money), Walras' Law implies that only `n-1` of the market-clearing equations are independent. If `n-1` markets clear, the last one must also clear.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 61."
        },
        {
            "question": "The classical economists assumed that the velocity of money was constant by definition.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Leading classical economists like Fisher and Marshall did not assume velocity was constant. They viewed it as being determined by stable institutional factors (like payment habits and financial technology) and thus being relatively stable or predictable in the short run, but not an absolute constant.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 61."
        },
        {
            "question": "A 'fiat money' system is one where the currency is backed by and convertible into a physical commodity like gold.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Fiat money is money that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. Its value comes from trust and its acceptance for payment of taxes.",
            "source": "Mizen, P.D. (1994), Chapter 2, p. 27."
        },
        {
            "question": "According to Patinkin, the real balance effect is the 'sine qua non' of monetary theory.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "Patinkin argued that the real balance effect is essential because, without it, there is no way to logically integrate the monetary and real sectors of the economy and ensure a determinate absolute price level in a Walrasian framework.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 4, p. 79."
        },
        {
            "question": "A decrease in the public's desired currency-to-deposit ratio would, ceteris paribus, decrease the overall money supply.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "A lower currency-to-deposit ratio means the public holds less cash and more deposits. This leaves more reserves in the banking system, allowing for a greater expansion of loans and deposits, thus increasing the money multiplier and the overall money supply.",
            "source": "Friedman, M. 'The quantity theory of money' in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance."
        },
        {
            "question": "The 'classical dichotomy' was proven to be logically valid by Don Patinkin.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Patinkin's work is famous for demonstrating the logical invalidity of the classical dichotomy. He showed that the separation of real and monetary analysis was inconsistent within a rigorous general equilibrium model.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 58."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a pure barter economy, there is no need for a numéraire or unit of account.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Even in a barter economy, a numéraire is needed to express the relative prices of goods. Without a common unit of account, one would need to know the exchange rate between every pair of goods (e.g., apples for bananas, apples for chairs, etc.), which is highly inefficient.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 54."
        },
        {
            "question": "The Cambridge cash-balance approach focuses on money as a medium of exchange, while the Fisherian transactions approach focuses on money as a store of value.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "The opposite is true. The Fisherian approach (MV=PT) emphasizes the use of money in transactions (medium of exchange). The Cambridge approach (M=kPY) focuses on the decision to hold money as part of a portfolio of assets (store of value).",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 62."
        },
        {
            "question": "If a government finances its spending by printing money, it is effectively imposing an 'inflation tax'.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "When the government prints money to finance spending, it increases the money supply, which leads to inflation. Inflation erodes the real value of the money held by the public. This loss of purchasing power is equivalent to a tax on holding money.",
            "source": "Friedman, M. 'The quantity theory of money' in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance."

        {
            "question": "Walras' Law is derived from the assumption that all markets are always in equilibrium.",
            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Walras' Law is derived from the aggregation of individual budget constraints. It holds true whether markets are in equilibrium or not. It simply states that the total value of planned purchases must equal the total value of planned sales (including endowments) for the economy as a whole.",
            "source": "Harris, L. (1985), Chapter 4, p. 53."
        },
        {
            "question": "The 'natural rate of interest' in Wicksell's theory is the rate that equates saving and investment.",
            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "Wicksell defined the natural rate of interest as the rate determined by real factors, corresponding to the marginal productivity of capital, which would exist if capital were lent 'in kind'. It is the rate that equates the demand for real capital (investment) and the supply of savings.",
            "source": "Lewis, M.K. and P.D. Mizen (2000), Chapter 3, p. 67."
        },
        {
            "question": "According to Wicksell, inflation occurs when the market rate of interest is above the natural rate.",

            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "An increase in population would increase the labor force and thus the full-employment level of output (T or Y). According to the quantity equation (MV=PT), with M and V constant, an increase in T would lead to a fall in the price level P.",

            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Patinkin's critique was not that the classicals ignored Walras' Law, but that they applied it inconsistently. They failed to see that Walras' Law logically connects the goods markets and the money market, making their dichotomized treatment of the two invalid.",

            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "In a fractional reserve system, banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. These loans create new deposits, which are in turn lent out, creating a multiplier effect where the total money supply (deposits + currency) is larger than the initial monetary base.",

            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "This is a complex issue. In the simplest models, neutrality holds. However, if a change in the money supply causes distributional effects (e.g., from creditors to debtors via unexpected inflation) and different groups have different spending propensities, then there can be real effects, violating strict neutrality.",

It is true by definition, as it simply states that the total value of money spent (MV) must equal the total value of items purchased (PT). The Quantity Theory of Money is the behavioral theory that builds upon this identity by making assumptions about the variables.",

            "answer": false,
            "explanation": "Patinkin's analysis showed that money is neutral precisely because of the operation of the real balance effect. An increase in M initially increases real balances, which boosts demand and pushes up P. Prices rise until P has increased proportionally to M, restoring real balances to their original level and leaving all real variables unchanged.",

            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "By framing the issue as a demand for a money asset (M=kPY), the Cambridge school opened the door to analyzing `k` not as a constant but as a variable that depends on factors like the interest rate on alternative assets, which is the opportunity cost of holding money.",

            "answer": true,
            "explanation": "This is an observed empirical regularity. During booms, confidence and spending are high, and interest rates tend to rise, all of which encourage a more intensive use of money, increasing its velocity. The opposite occurs during recessions.",
