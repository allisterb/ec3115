    {
        question: "What is the primary defining feature of business cycles?",
        options: [
            "Fluctuations in the nominal GDP growth rate.",
            "Fluctuations of real GDP around a smooth trend.",
            "Long-run increases in a nation's productive capacity.",
            "Seasonal variations in employment and production."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Business cycles are specifically about the fluctuations in *real* economic activity, not nominal, to remove the effects of inflation. They are defined as deviations from a long-run growth trend, which represents the economy's potential output. Seasonal variations are predictable and are statistically removed from the data before analyzing business cycles.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Regularities in GDP Fluctuations'. and EC3115 - Ch 6 Stylised facts-2.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "When analysing a time series that exhibits growth, taking the natural logarithm is useful because the slope of the log-transformed series approximates what?",
        options: [
            "The absolute level of the variable.",
            "The growth rate of the variable.",
            "The volatility of the variable.",
            "The long-run trend of the variable."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "A key mathematical property is that for small changes, the change in the log of a variable is approximately equal to its percentage growth rate (i.e., \(\Delta \ln(Y) \approx \Delta Y / Y\)). This transformation converts a variable with exponential growth into a series that is approximately linear in time, where the slope of the line represents the average growth rate.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 1, 'Gross Domestic Product, Economic Growth, and Business Cycles'."
    },
    {
        question: "The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is a common method for what purpose in business cycle analysis?",
        options: [
            "Calculating the inflation rate.",
            "Forecasting future GDP.",
            "Separating a time series into its trend and cyclical components.",
            "Measuring the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The HP filter is a data-smoothing technique that decomposes a time series into two parts: a smooth, long-term trend component and a short-term cyclical component. The business cycle is then identified with this cyclical component. It works by fitting a trend line that balances the trade-off between fitting the data closely and being smooth.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 1, Figure 1.3 footnote. and EC3115 - Ch 6 Stylised facts-2.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "If a macroeconomic variable's deviations from trend are positively correlated with the deviations from trend in real GDP, the variable is said to be:",
        options: [
            "Acyclical",
            "Countercyclical",
            "Procyclical",
            "A leading indicator"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Procyclical means 'moving with the cycle'. A positive correlation indicates that when GDP is above its trend (a boom), the variable also tends to be above its trend, and vice versa for recessions. Consumption and investment are classic examples of procyclical variables.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Comovement'. and EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "Which statistical moment is typically used to measure the volatility of a business cycle component?",
        options: [
            "The mean",
            "The standard deviation",
            "The covariance",
            "The autocorrelation coefficient"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Volatility measures the size of fluctuations, or the typical magnitude of a variable's deviation from its trend. The standard deviation is the standard statistical measure of dispersion around a mean. A higher standard deviation implies larger and more volatile swings.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Comovement'. and EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "The persistence of a business cycle component is measured by its:",
        options: [
            "Correlation with GDP",
            "Standard deviation",
            "Autocorrelation coefficient",
            "Covariance with inflation"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Persistence captures the 'momentum' of a cycle. A persistent variable, if above trend today, is likely to remain above trend tomorrow. This is measured by the autocorrelation coefficient, which calculates the correlation of the variable with its own past values (e.g., the correlation between GDP cycle at time t and at time t-1).",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Regularities in GDP Fluctuations'. and EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "Which of the following is a key business cycle stylised fact regarding consumption?",
        options: [
            "It is countercyclical and more volatile than GDP.",
            "It is procyclical and more volatile than GDP.",
            "It is procyclical and less volatile than GDP.",
            "It is acyclical and less volatile than GDP."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Consumption is procyclical (it rises in booms and falls in recessions). However, it is significantly less volatile (smoother) than GDP. This is attributed to 'consumption-smoothing' behavior, where households save during good times to support their consumption during bad times.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'The Components of GDP'."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the volatility of investment typically compare to the volatility of GDP?",
        options: [
            "Investment is significantly less volatile than GDP.",
            "Investment has approximately the same volatility as GDP.",
            "Investment is significantly more volatile than GDP.",
            "The volatility relationship is acyclical and unpredictable."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Investment spending is notoriously volatile, with its standard deviation being about three times that of GDP. This is because investment decisions are forward-looking, depend on volatile expectations of future profits, and can be easily postponed by firms during times of uncertainty.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'The Components of GDP'."
    },
    {
        question: "According to the stylised facts for the US economy, employment is:",
        options: [
            "Procyclical and leading",
            "Countercyclical and lagging",
            "Procyclical and lagging",
            "Acyclical and coincident"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Employment is procyclical, as more workers are needed during expansions. It is considered a lagging indicator because firms are often cautious and wait to confirm a recovery is robust before hiring new workers, and they are reluctant to fire workers at the beginning of a downturn.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Labor Market Variables'."
    },
    {
        question: "The 'output gap' is a term commonly used to refer to:",
        options: [
            "The difference between nominal and real GDP.",
            "The business cycle component of a log-transformed real output series.",
            "The difference between a country's GDP and its main trading partner's GDP.",
            "The amount of output lost due to seasonal adjustments."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The output gap is the percentage deviation of actual real GDP from its potential (or trend) level. It is a key indicator of an economy's state in the business cycle. A positive gap suggests the economy is overheating (inflationary), while a negative gap suggests slack (unemployment).",
        source: "EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "What does a correlation coefficient of -0.8 between a variable and real GDP imply?",
        options: [
            "The variable is strongly procyclical.",
            "The variable is strongly countercyclical.",
            "The variable is acyclical.",
            "The variable leads the business cycle."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A negative value indicates that the two variables move in opposite directions. A value of -0.8 is close to -1, indicating a strong negative relationship. This is the definition of a strongly countercyclical variable (e.g., the unemployment rate).",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Comovement'. and EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "The stylised facts for the US indicate that the price level is ________, and the inflation rate is ________.",
        options: [
            "procyclical; procyclical",
            "countercyclical; procyclical",
            "procyclical; countercyclical",
            "countercyclical; countercyclical"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "This is a subtle but important fact. The overall price level tends to be countercyclical (below trend in a boom). However, the rate of change of prices, inflation, tends to be procyclical (it accelerates during a boom). This can happen if productivity shocks are driving the cycle.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'The Price Level and Inflation'."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the 'Phillips Curve' in its traditional, empirical form?",
        options: [
            "A positive relationship between inflation and money supply.",
            "A negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.",
            "A positive relationship between consumption and investment.",
            "A negative relationship between real wages and employment."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The original Phillips curve, based on empirical data from the UK by A.W. Phillips, showed a stable inverse relationship between the rate of wage inflation and the unemployment rate. This was later adapted to be a relationship between price inflation and unemployment, suggesting a policy trade-off between the two.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'The Price Level and Inflation'. and EC3115 - Ch 6 Stylised facts-2.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "According to Friedman and Kuttner (1992), what happened to the relationship between monetary aggregates and nominal income in the US after the 1980s?",
        options: [
            "The relationship became much stronger and more predictable.",
            "The relationship remained stable and unchanged.",
            "The relationship sharply weakened and became unreliable for policy.",
            "The relationship inverted, with money growth negatively predicting income."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "This paper is famous for documenting the 'breakdown' of the money-income relationship. The previously stable correlation that had supported monetarist policy ideas disappeared, likely due to financial innovations and deregulation that made the velocity of money unstable. This rendered monetary aggregates poor information variables for policy.",
        source: "Friedman, B. and K. N. Kuttner ‘Money, income, prices and interest rates’."
    },
    {
        question: "What variable did Friedman and Kuttner (1992) find to be a consistently significant predictor of future movements in real income?",
        options: [
            "The M1 money supply.",
            "The growth rate of the monetary base.",
            "The spread between the commercial paper rate and the Treasury bill rate.",
            "The 30-year government bond yield."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "While the monetary aggregates lost their predictive power, the authors found that the spread between the commercial paper rate (a rate on short-term private debt) and the Treasury bill rate (risk-free government debt) remained a robust predictor. This spread is seen as an indicator of financial market stress and default risk.",
        source: "Friedman, B. and K. N. Kuttner ‘Money, income, prices and interest rates’."
    },
    {
        question: "Aksoy and Piskorski (2006) argue that the breakdown in the money-income relationship can be partially explained by what factor?",
        options: [
            "The shift from a manufacturing to a service economy.",
            "The failure to account for foreign holdings of U.S. dollars.",
            "Changes in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).",
            "The adoption of inflation targeting by the Federal Reserve."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "They argue that a large and fluctuating portion of the US currency stock is held abroad. Changes in foreign demand for dollars can distort the measured money supply, breaking its link with the domestic US economy. By estimating and removing these foreign holdings, they construct a 'domestic money' measure that shows a more stable relationship with US output and inflation.",
        source: "Aksoy, Y. and T. Piskorski ‘US domestic money, inflation and output’."
    },
    {
        question: "According to De Grauwe and Polan (2005), the strong link between money growth and inflation is almost wholly due to what?",
        options: [
            "The data from OECD countries.",
            "The inclusion of high-inflation (or hyperinflation) countries in the sample.",
            "The use of M1 instead of M2 as the monetary aggregate.",
            "The period after the year 2000."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Their key finding is that the famous monetarist dictum 'inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon' is context-dependent. When they split their cross-country sample, the strong positive correlation between money growth and inflation is driven entirely by countries that have experienced periods of high inflation. For countries that have consistently maintained low inflation, the relationship is very weak or non-existent.",
        source: "de Grauwe, P. and Polan, M. (2005) ‘Is inflation always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon?’."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the 'flattening' of the Phillips curve, as documented by Kuttner and Robinson (2010)?",
        options: [
            "Inflation has become more responsive to fluctuations in the output gap.",
            "The long-run Phillips curve is no longer vertical.",
            "Inflation has become less responsive to fluctuations in the output gap.",
            "The unemployment rate has become more volatile."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "A 'flat' Phillips curve means its slope is close to zero. This implies that even a large change in the output gap (or unemployment rate) will only produce a small change in the rate of inflation. This has been a key feature of many advanced economies in recent decades, making it harder for central banks to influence inflation by managing aggregate demand.",
        source: "Kuttner, K.N. and T. Robinson ‘Understanding the flattening of Phillips curve’."
    },
    {
        question: "Which of the following is a key business cycle stylised fact regarding average labor productivity?",
        options: [
            "It is countercyclical and lagging.",
            "It is procyclical and leading.",
            "It is acyclical.",
            "It is procyclical and coincident."
        ],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: "Average labor productivity (output per worker, Y/N) is procyclical. It tends to rise in expansions and fall in recessions. This is partly because firms can use their existing workforce more intensively during a boom before hiring new workers. Its timing is generally coincident with the overall cycle.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Labor Market Variables'."
    },
    {
        question: "The term 'comovement' in business cycle analysis refers to:",
        options: [
            "The tendency for GDP to revert to its trend.",
            "The tendency for macroeconomic variables to move together in predictable patterns over the business cycle.",
            "The movement of two different countries' GDPs in sync.",
            "The idea that all components of GDP have the same volatility."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Comovement is about identifying stable patterns of correlation among different macroeconomic variables. Analyzing which variables are procyclical, countercyclical, or acyclical, and which are leading, lagging, or coincident, helps us understand the underlying structure of the economy and provides facts that business cycle models should be able to replicate.",
        source: "Williamson, S.D. Macroeconomics, Chapter 3, 'Comovement'."
    },
    {
        question: "What does a high autocorrelation coefficient (close to 1) for the cyclical component of real GDP indicate?",
        options: [
            "High volatility",
            "Acyclicality",
            "High persistence",
            "A leading indicator"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "A high autocorrelation means that the value of the series in one period is highly correlated with its value in the previous period. For the GDP cycle, this means a boom or recession has momentum: if GDP is above trend today, it is very likely to be above trend next quarter. This property is known as persistence.",
        source: "EC3115 - Monetary Economics Unit F Lectures.pdf"
    },
    {
        question: "According to Calderon and Fuertes (2014), how do recessions in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) typically compare to those in industrial countries?",
        options: [
            "They are shorter in duration and less deep.",
            "They have a similar duration but are deeper and steeper.",
            "They are longer in duration but less deep.",
            "They are identical in all major characteristics."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The study finds that while the length of recessions is not systematically different, the severity is. Recessions in EMEs are characterized by a larger drop in output (deeper) and a faster rate of decline (steeper), leading to a greater overall output loss compared to recessions in advanced, industrial economies.",
        source: "Calderon, C. and R. Fuertes ‘Have business cycles changed over the last two decades?’."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a key implication of a flatter Phillips curve for monetary policy?",
        options: [
            "Reducing inflation has become less costly in terms of lost output.",
            "A positive output gap is now much more inflationary.",
            "The cost of reducing inflation, once it is established, has increased.",
            "Monetary policy can no longer affect the unemployment rate."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "A flatter Phillips curve means that a given change in unemployment or the output gap has a smaller effect on inflation. This implies a higher 'sacrifice ratio'. To achieve a 1% reduction in inflation, the central bank must now engineer a much larger and more painful increase in unemployment than in the past.",
        source: "Kuttner, K.N. and T. Robinson ‘Understanding the flattening of Phillips curve’."
    },
    {
        question: "The 'Lucas critique', in essence, argues that:",

If the policy changes, the parameters will change, making the model useless for predicting the effects of the policy change.
