                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Financial intermediaries perform three main functions: <br>1. They alleviate market imperfections caused by economies of scale in transactions and in information gathering and portfolio management. <br>2. They provide insurance services. <br>3. They reconcile the differing holding period preferences of savers and lenders, a process known as maturity transformation.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Maturity transformation is vital because savers (lenders) generally prefer to keep their assets in liquid, short-term forms for transaction and precautionary purposes. In contrast, borrowers (e.g., firms financing investment projects) prefer to issue long-term liabilities to match the expected life of their investments. Banks bridge this gap by accepting short-term deposits and providing long-term loans, transforming maturities to meet the divergent needs of both parties.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Deposits appear on the <strong>liabilities</strong> side of a bank's balance sheet. This is because deposits represent money that the bank owes to its customers. <br>Loans appear on the <strong>assets</strong> side. This is because loans are money that is owed <em>to</em> the bank by its borrowers, representing a future stream of income for the bank.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A balance sheet is an accounting identity. It must balance by definition because the value of a bank's assets (what it owns and what is owed to it) must equal the sum of its liabilities (what it owes to others) and its own net worth (or equity capital). The equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth. Any change on one side must be met with an equal change on the other.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> The monetary base (H), also known as high-powered money, consists of the total liabilities of the central bank. It is comprised of two main components: <br>1. Currency in circulation (C): Notes and coins held by the non-bank public. <br>2. Total Reserves (R): These are the commercial banks' holdings of vault cash plus their deposits at the central bank.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A central bank can increase the monetary base by conducting an open market purchase. It buys government bonds from commercial banks in the open market. The central bank pays for these bonds by crediting the reserve accounts of the commercial banks. This action directly increases the reserves (R) of the banking system, and therefore increases the monetary base (H = C + R). With more reserves, banks can create more loans and deposits, expanding the overall money supply through the money multiplier effect.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> The money multiplier (m) describes the relationship between the total money supply (M) and the monetary base (H). It shows how much the money supply changes for a given change in the monetary base. The formula is: \(M = m \times H\). The size of the multiplier is determined by the currency-deposit ratio and the reserve-deposit ratio.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A mandatory reserve ratio (r*) is a regulation set by the central bank that requires commercial banks to hold a certain fraction of their deposit liabilities as reserves, which cannot be lent out. Imposing or increasing the reserve ratio reduces the amount of excess reserves a bank has available for lending. This restricts the bank's capacity to create new loans and deposits. As a result, the money multiplier decreases, and for any given monetary base, the total money supply contracts.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> The currency-deposit ratio (cr = C/D) is the ratio of currency held by the public (C) to the amount of checkable deposits they hold in banks (D). It reflects the public's preference for holding cash versus deposits. When the public decides to hold more currency (an increase in cr), less money is deposited in the banking system. This reduces the amount of reserves available for banks to lend out, thereby shrinking the base for multiple deposit creation. A higher currency-deposit ratio leads to a smaller money multiplier.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A fiat money system is one where the money (e.g., paper notes, coins) is not convertible by law into anything other than itself and has no fixed value in terms of any objective standard or commodity. Its value comes from the social convention of being generally accepted for payments and its status as legal tender, ultimately resting on the trust that the issuing authority (the central bank) will manage its supply to maintain its purchasing power.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Under a commodity money standard, the monetary unit has a value tied to a specific commodity, like gold. The currency is convertible into a specified amount of that commodity, which anchors its value. Under a fiat money standard, the currency has no intrinsic value and is not convertible into any commodity. Its value is based on trust and legal decree. The supply of commodity money is constrained by the physical availability of the commodity, while the supply of fiat money is controlled by the monetary authority.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Financial intermediaries achieve economies of scale in two main ways: <br>1. <strong>Transaction Costs:</strong> By pooling the small savings of many individuals, they can make large loans, which is more efficient than many small individuals trying to lend directly. <br>2. <strong>Information Costs:</strong> They specialize in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers, a task that would be costly and difficult for individual savers to perform. This specialization reduces the overall cost of information gathering in the economy.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Banks provide insurance to depositors by guaranteeing a rate of return on their deposits, even if some of the loans the bank makes to borrowers turn out to be bad and are defaulted on. The bank absorbs the default risk, which would otherwise be borne entirely by the individual saver if they lent directly to the borrower. This service reduces the risk for depositors and provides them with a higher level of utility.</div>

It is determined by two factors: <br>1. <strong>Regulatory Requirements:</strong> The central bank often mandates a minimum required reserve ratio. <br>2. <strong>Bank Policy:</strong> Banks may choose to hold excess reserves above the required minimum for precautionary reasons, to manage liquidity and ensure they can meet unexpected withdrawals. The level of excess reserves is typically an inverse function of the interest rate, as holding reserves has an opportunity cost (forgone interest on loans).</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> The classical dichotomy is the theoretical separation between the real and monetary sides of the economy. In this view, real variables (like output, employment, and relative prices) are determined purely by real factors (like technology, resource endowments, and preferences). Monetary variables (like the money supply) are thought to only influence nominal variables (like the absolute price level), but have no effect on real outcomes. This concept implies the neutrality of money.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Patinkin argued the classical dichotomy was logically inconsistent. He pointed out a contradiction: <br>1. According to Walras's Law in classical models, demand functions, including the demand for money, should depend only on relative prices. <br>2. According to the Quantity Theory of Money, the demand for money depends on the absolute price level. <br>To resolve this, Patinkin introduced the 'Real Balance Effect', where individuals' real money balances (M/P) are an argument in their demand functions for goods, thus building a bridge between the monetary and real sectors.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> The Real Balance Effect, proposed by Don Patinkin, states that the real value of money balances (M/P) held by the public is a component of their wealth. Therefore, a change in the price level (P) alters real wealth, which in turn affects households' spending decisions (demand for goods). For example, a fall in the price level increases real balances, making people feel wealthier and causing them to increase their consumption spending.</div>

The 'gold import point' is the rate at which it becomes profitable to convert foreign currency into gold and ship it home.

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> When the central bank injects new reserves into the banking system (e.g., via an open market purchase), the initial bank receiving the reserves now has excess reserves. It lends out these excess reserves. The borrower spends the money, and the recipient deposits it in a second bank. This second bank now has increased deposits and reserves, and it too lends out its new excess reserves. This process of re-lending and re-depositing continues from bank to bank, with each round creating new deposits, leading to a total expansion of deposits that is a multiple of the initial injection of reserves.</div>

It assumes banks hold no excess reserves. <br>2. It assumes the public holds no currency (i.e., all money is held as deposits). <br>In reality, both banks holding excess reserves and the public holding currency act as 'leaks' from the multiple deposit creation process, reducing the size of the multiplier.</div>

In a bimetallic system, if the legally fixed mint ratio of gold to silver differs from the market ratio, one metal will be overvalued at the mint and the other undervalued. The undervalued metal ('good money') will be hoarded, melted down, or exported, disappearing from circulation. The overvalued metal ('bad money') will be the one predominantly used for transactions. This often caused bimetallic systems to degenerate into de facto monometallic (gold or silver) standards.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> An intermediate target is a variable that is not directly controlled by the central bank but is closely linked to its ultimate policy goals and is responsive to its instruments. Examples include the money supply (like M2 or M3) or the exchange rate. The idea is that by hitting a target for the intermediate variable, the central bank can achieve its ultimate goal for inflation or output.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Goodhart's Law, named after economist Charles Goodhart, states that 'Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.' In the context of monetary policy, it means that when a central bank tries to control an economic variable (like a particular monetary aggregate) that was previously a reliable indicator, the relationship between that indicator and the ultimate policy goal will break down because economic agents will change their behaviour in response to the new policy regime.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Symmetallism was a monetary standard proposed by Alfred Marshall as an alternative to bimetallism. The monetary unit would be defined as a physical combination of gold and silver (e.g., a bar containing one ounce of gold and fifteen ounces of silver). Unlike bimetallism, the relative price of gold and silver would be free to vary. The goal was to create a more stable price level by broadening the commodity base of the currency.</div>

The idea was to have a dollar that was convertible into gold, but the gold content of the dollar would be adjusted periodically to offset changes in the general price level. If a price index rose, the gold content of the dollar would be increased (making the dollar more valuable) to bring the price level back down, and vice versa.</div>

This involves the real costs of mining, refining, and storing the commodity. As Sir Roy Harrod noted, it involves digging gold out of the ground only to rebury it in central bank vaults.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A fractional reserve system allows the total money supply (including bank deposits) to be a multiple of the actual commodity money (e.g., gold) held in reserve. By creating credit money (banknotes and deposits) on top of a smaller base of commodity money, the system economizes on the amount of the valuable commodity that needs to be held for monetary purposes, thus reducing the overall resource cost to society.</div>

Retail banking involves a large number of small individual accounts (households and small firms). A key theoretical difference is that retail banks can use the law of large numbers to predict deposit withdrawals and determine reserve holdings, a principle that is not applicable to the large, lumpy transactions in wholesale banking.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> 'Riding the yield curve' is a strategy used by wholesale banks to profit from the term structure of interest rates. If the yield curve is upward sloping (long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates), a bank can borrow funds at short-term rates and lend them out at longer-term rates. This positive maturity transformation creates a profitable interest rate differential, or spread, for the bank.</div>

It imposed a progressive penalty (in the form of non-interest-bearing special deposits at the Bank of England) on banks whose interest-bearing eligible liabilities (IBELs) grew faster than a predetermined allowable rate. It was designed to make it costly for banks to bid for wholesale deposits to fund lending, thereby restraining credit and money growth.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Disintermediation is the process whereby financial flows are diverted away from traditional intermediaries (like banks) and into other channels. Direct controls like the 'corset' encouraged this by making bank intermediation more costly. For example, instead of a company borrowing from a bank, the bank might arrange for the company to issue a commercial bill which is then sold directly to a non-bank lender, bypassing the bank's balance sheet. This is also known as 're-routing' of credit.</div>

If the long-run demand function for base money is stable, setting one should be equivalent to setting the other. However, the two regimes are different in practice because they imply different behaviors and responses to shocks from the central bank and private sector.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A key difference is the degree of discretion and the number of factors considered by the central bank. Under interest rate control, the central bank is inclined to take many factors (e.g., political pressure, current economic data) into account when setting the rate. A monetary base control regime is seen as a way of forcing the authorities to be less discretionary and to focus solely on the quantity of base money, thereby purging the interest rate reaction function of other arguments.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Liability management is the practice by which banks, when they need more reserves, actively bid for funds in the wholesale money markets (e.g., the interbank market) to support their lending, rather than selling off assets. This practice is possible in modern financial systems where central banks typically accommodate the system's demand for reserves at a price (the policy interest rate) to ensure financial stability.</div>

In this view, individuals do not continuously adjust their money holdings to a desired target level but tolerate deviations within certain upper and lower bounds. This approach helps explain why money holdings can deviate systematically from their long-run demand function in the short run.</div>

The dealer sells the government securities to investors, usually on an overnight basis, and buys them back the following day at a slightly higher price. For the party selling the security (and agreeing to repurchase it in the future) it is a repo; for the party on the other end of the transaction (buying the security and agreeing to sell in the future) it is a reverse repurchase agreement.</div>

When a government prints money to finance its spending, it increases the money supply, which leads to a rise in the price level.

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Monetary neutrality is the idea that a one-time change in the stock of money affects only nominal variables, such as the price level, but does not affect real variables like real output, employment, or real interest rates. In essence, if the money supply doubles, the only long-run effect will be a doubling of all prices.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> A bank run is a situation where a large number of a bank's depositors, fearing the bank may become insolvent, simultaneously attempt to withdraw their funds. Because banks operate on a fractional reserve basis and engage in maturity transformation (holding illiquid long-term assets against liquid short-term liabilities), they cannot satisfy all withdrawal requests at once, leading to the bank's failure even if it was originally solvent.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Deposit insurance, typically provided by a government agency, guarantees that depositors will receive their money back up to a certain limit, even if their bank fails. This removes the incentive for depositors to rush to withdraw their funds at the first sign of trouble, thereby reducing the likelihood of a bank run and promoting financial stability.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Moral hazard is a situation where one party gets involved in a risky event knowing that it is protected against the risk and the other party will incur the cost. In banking, deposit insurance can create moral hazard by giving bank managers an incentive to take on excessive risk, knowing that if the risks pay off, the bank profits, but if they fail, the deposit insurance fund (and ultimately, taxpayers) will cover the losses to depositors.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Adverse selection is a problem that arises in markets where there is asymmetric information before a transaction occurs. In lending, it's the tendency for those who are the most eager to borrow money to be the riskiest borrowers (i.e., those most likely to default). Lenders have difficulty distinguishing good from bad credit risks, which can lead to a reduction in the overall level of lending.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Credit rationing occurs when a lender limits the supply of loans to borrowers, even if those borrowers are willing to pay a higher interest rate. This can happen in markets with imperfect information, where raising the interest rate might worsen the adverse selection problem (by attracting even riskier borrowers) or the moral hazard problem (by incentivizing borrowers to take on more risk).</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> The bank lending channel is a component of the monetary transmission mechanism. It suggests that when the central bank tightens monetary policy (e.g., by draining reserves), it reduces the supply of loanable funds from the banking system. This reduction in the supply of bank loans, particularly for smaller firms that are dependent on bank credit, can lead to a contraction in investment and economic activity, even if market interest rates do not rise significantly.</div>

                    <div class="answer"><strong>A:</strong> Sterilization is a monetary policy action taken by a central bank to insulate the domestic money supply from the effects of foreign exchange interventions. For example, if a country has a balance of payments surplus and the central bank is buying foreign currency, this would normally increase the domestic monetary base. To sterilize this inflow, the central bank would conduct a simultaneous open market sale of domestic bonds to drain the extra liquidity from the system.</div>

In this situation, the public is willing to hold any amount of money supplied by the central bank rather than buying bonds, because the opportunity cost of holding money is virtually zero.

For example, a central bank may announce a policy of zero inflation to anchor public expectations. However, once the public has formed its expectations, the central bank may have an incentive to create a 'surprise' inflation to temporarily boost output. Rational agents will anticipate this incentive, making the initial low-inflation promise not credible.</div>
