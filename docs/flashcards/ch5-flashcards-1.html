                <div class="front">What is the Cambridge cash-balance equation?</div>
                <div class="back">The Cambridge equation is \(M = kPY\), where M is the stock of money, P is the price level, Y is real income, and k is the proportion of income that people choose to hold as cash balances.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf; mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>

                <div class="back">In the context of the income version of the quantity theory (MV=PY), the Cambridge k is the reciprocal of the income velocity of circulation. That is, \(k = 1/V\).<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the Classical Dichotomy?</div>
                <div class="back">The Classical Dichotomy is the theoretical separation of the real and monetary sectors of the economy. It proposes that real variables (like output and relative prices) are determined by real factors, while nominal variables (like the absolute price level) are determined by monetary factors alone.<div class="source">Source: EC3115 - Ch 5 Classical theory-1.pdf; mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Explain the concept of money as a 'veil'.</div>
                <div class="back">In classical theory, money is seen as a 'veil' that covers the real workings of the economy. It facilitates transactions but does not fundamentally affect real outcomes like production, consumption, or relative prices. The real economy is thought to operate independently of the quantity of money.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">State Walras' Law.</div>
                <div class="back">Walras' Law states that the sum of the values of excess demands across all markets in an economy must identically be equal to zero. \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i ED_i = 0\)<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf; EC3115 - Ch 5 Classical theory-1.pdf</div></div>

                <div class="front">What is the primary implication of Walras' Law in a general equilibrium system with 'n' markets?</div>
                <div class="back">The primary implication is that if \(n-1\) markets are in equilibrium (i.e., have zero excess demand), then the nth market must also be in equilibrium. This means the market-clearing equations are not independent.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What was Don Patinkin's fundamental criticism of the Classical Dichotomy?</div>
                <div class="back">Patinkin argued that the Classical Dichotomy was logically inconsistent. The classical model determined relative prices in the real sector and the absolute price level in the monetary sector, but Walras' Law implies these two sectors are interdependent, creating a contradiction.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf; mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Define the 'real balance effect'.</div>
                <div class="back">The real balance effect (or Pigou effect) states that the real value of money balances (M/P) is a component of wealth. Therefore, a change in the price level (P) affects real wealth, which in turn influences consumption and the demand for goods.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf; mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">How does the real balance effect resolve the inconsistency in the classical model?</div>
                <div class="back">It provides a direct link between the monetary sector (the price level P) and the real sector (demand for goods). By making the demand for goods dependent on real balances (M/P), it invalidates the Homogeneity Postulate and ensures the absolute price level is determinate within a consistent general equilibrium framework.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf; mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the 'homogeneity postulate' in the context of classical theory?</div>
                <div class="back">The homogeneity postulate asserts that the demand for goods is homogeneous of degree zero in money prices and the absolute price level. This means that a proportionate change in all money prices (leaving relative prices unchanged) will not affect the quantity of goods demanded.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Why is the absolute price level indeterminate in a pure barter Walrasian model?</div>
                <div class="back">Because the demand and supply for goods depend only on relative prices. Any set of absolute prices that maintains the same equilibrium relative prices is a valid solution. The system can only determine \(n-1\) relative prices, not \(n\) absolute prices.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">How does Patinkin's model demonstrate the invalidity of Say's Law as an identity?</div>
                <div class="back">In Patinkin's model, an increase in real balances (e.g., from a fall in P) causes an excess demand for goods. Since the excess demand for all goods is no longer identically zero, there can be a general glut or shortage of goods, which means Say's Law (that aggregate supply equals aggregate demand) does not hold as an identity, only as an equilibrium condition.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the monetary base (or high-powered money)?</div>
                <div class="back">The monetary base (H) is the sum of currency in circulation (C) and the reserves held by commercial banks at the central bank (R). It represents the total liabilities of the central bank. \(H = C + R\)<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p33-39.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">How do the monetary authorities influence the money supply by changing the monetary base?</div>
                <div class="back">The primary method is through open market operations. By buying government securities from commercial banks, the central bank increases bank reserves, thereby expanding the monetary base and allowing for a multiplied expansion of the money supply. Selling securities has the opposite effect.<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p33-39.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Explain the role of the required reserve ratio in the money creation process.</div>
                <div class="back">The required reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold as reserves and cannot lend out. A lower reserve ratio allows banks to lend a larger portion of each deposit, which increases the money multiplier and leads to a larger total money supply for a given monetary base.<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p33-39.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the money multiplier?</div>
                <div class="back">The money multiplier is the ratio of the total money supply (M) to the monetary base (H). It shows the amount by which the money supply changes for a one-unit change in the monetary base. Its value depends on the currency-deposit ratio and the reserve-deposit ratio.<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p33-39.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">In the Cambridge equation \(M = kPY\), what factors determine the value of 'k'?</div>
                <div class="back">The value of 'k' (the desired proportion of income to be held as money) is determined by institutional factors, such as the payment habits of the community (e.g., frequency of wage payments), the efficiency of the banking system, and the general level of confidence.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Distinguish between the 'transactions' and 'cash-balance' approaches to the quantity theory.</div>
                <div class="back">The transactions approach (Fisher) emphasizes money as a medium of exchange and focuses on the flow of money in transactions (MV=PT). The cash-balance approach (Cambridge) emphasizes money as a store of value and focuses on the stock of money people desire to hold (M=kPY).<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p33-39.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is a 'Walrasian auctioneer'?</div>
                <div class="back">The Walrasian auctioneer is a fictional entity in general equilibrium theory. The auctioneer calls out a set of prices, gathers information on supply and demand from all market participants, and adjusts prices until all markets clear simultaneously. No trade occurs until equilibrium prices are found.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the process of 'tâtonnement'?</div>
                <div class="back">'Tâtonnement' (French for 'groping') is the trial-and-error process, managed by the Walrasian auctioneer, of adjusting prices to find the general equilibrium set of prices where supply equals demand in all markets.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">In the classical system, what determines the real rate of interest?</div>
                <div class="back">The real rate of interest is determined by real factors, specifically the interaction of the economy's productivity (which determines the demand for investment funds) and thrift (which determines the supply of savings).<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Why does a change in the money supply not affect the real interest rate in the classical model?</div>
                <div class="back">Due to the classical dichotomy and neutrality of money. A change in the money supply only affects the price level. The real interest rate is determined by real factors (productivity and thrift) which are assumed to be independent of the quantity of money.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the difference between Say's Law and Walras' Law?</div>
                <div class="back">Say's Law ("supply creates its own demand") refers to the aggregate of goods markets, stating there can be no general glut of goods. Walras' Law is more general, stating that the sum of excess demands across ALL markets (including money and bonds) must be zero. Walras' Law allows for a general glut of goods, provided it is matched by an excess demand for money.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">According to Patinkin, why is the real balance effect the 'sine qua non' of monetary theory?</div>
                <div class="back">Patinkin claimed it was the 'sine qua non' (an essential condition) because, in his view, it was the only mechanism that could logically integrate the monetary and real sectors, resolve the classical dichotomy's inconsistency, and provide a determinate theory of the absolute price level within a Walrasian framework.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is 'inside money' versus 'outside money'?</div>
                <div class="back">'Outside money' is a net asset to the private sector, typically created by the government (e.g., fiat currency). 'Inside money' is created within the private sector and is simultaneously an asset for one agent and a liability for another (e.g., a commercial bank deposit.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">Does the real balance effect operate with 'inside money'?</div>
                <div class="back">This is a point of debate. If inside money is considered, a fall in the price level increases the real value of assets for creditors but also increases the real value of liabilities for debtors. If these effects cancel out, there is no net real balance effect for the private sector as a whole. However, if there are distributional effects, it might still operate.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the 'direct mechanism' of monetary transmission in classical theory?</div>
                <div class="back">The direct mechanism refers to the effect of a change in the money supply directly on spending. If individuals find themselves with excess money balances, they spend them directly on goods and services, bidding up the price level until equilibrium is restored.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the 'indirect mechanism' of monetary transmission?</div>
                <div class="back">The indirect mechanism works through the interest rate. An increase in the money supply first leads to an increase in loanable funds, which lowers the market rate of interest. This stimulates investment demand, which in turn increases aggregate demand and the price level.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the 'natural rate of interest' in Wicksell's theory?</div>
                <div class="back">The natural rate of interest is the rate that equates the supply of savings with the demand for investment and corresponds to the marginal productivity of capital. It is the rate consistent with a stable price level.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What is the 'market rate of interest' in Wicksell's theory?</div>
                <div class="back">The market rate of interest is the actual rate charged by banks on loans. The cumulative process of inflation or deflation begins when the market rate diverges from the natural rate.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">
                <div class="front">What happens if the market rate of interest is below the natural rate?</div>
                <div class="back">If the market rate is below the natural rate, investment demand will exceed savings. Entrepreneurs will borrow to invest, expanding aggregate demand. This leads to a cumulative process of inflation as long as the market rate remains below the natural rate.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-3.pdf</div></div>
            </div>

            <div class="flashcard">

                <div class="back">Banks are only required to hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves. They lend out the rest. When a loan is made, it is typically deposited in another bank, which in turn keeps a fraction in reserve and lends out the rest. This process of re-lending creates new deposits and thus new money, in a multiple of the original deposit.<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p33-39.pdf</div></div>

                <div class="back">The gold standard is a monetary system where a country's standard currency unit is defined as a fixed quantity of gold.

                <div class="back">'Gold points' are the upper and lower limits to the fluctuation of the foreign exchange rate between two countries on the gold standard. The limits are determined by the mint parity exchange rate plus or minus the costs of shipping gold between the two countries. If the exchange rate moves beyond the gold points, it becomes profitable to ship gold instead of using the foreign exchange market.<div class="source">Source: mizen-pages-4.pdf</div></div>

                <div class="back">Hume argued that in the short-run "interval or intermediate situation" between the injection of new money and the full rise in the price level, the money circulates and stimulates economic activity and production before all prices have had a chance to adjust upwards.<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p262-277.pdf</div></div>

                <div class="back">This argument suggests that inflation, caused by a monetary expansion, can redistribute income from wage-earners (who are assumed to save less) to profit-earners (who are assumed to save and invest more). This 'forces' an increase in the economy's overall saving and investment rate, affecting the real capital stock and thus having a real effect.<div class="source">Source: palgrave_p262-277.pdf</div></div>

                <div class="back">Although an initial increase in the money supply causes a temporary real balance effect (increasing demand for goods), this excess demand pushes up the price level. The price level will continue to rise until it has increased in the same proportion as the money supply. At this point, real balances (M/P) are restored to their original level, and all real variables return to their initial equilibrium values.<div class="source">Source: harris_p30-52.pdf</div></div>
